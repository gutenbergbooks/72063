<hr class="full">

<p>Since the childhood of the races, certain
old-world stories have appeared in different
form in the folklore of different nations, all
bearing the stamp of the same source; the
interest of primitive people in attributing
human impulses and human lines of conduct
to the animal world.</p>

<p>Perhaps the earliest of all is The Kid Who
Would Not Go, which corresponds to the old
New England nursery tale of the Old Woman
and Her Pig, and which, in its original form,
dates back to Hebrew translations. How
They Brought Hairlock Home is a typical cumulative
tale of Norway. The Story of Ibbity
is one of the few obtainable Madagascar folk
tales, and symbolizes the search of a primitive
people for the source of natural phenomena.
Our own southern negroes have given us the
stories of Mr. Elephant and Mr. Frog, Why
the Bear Sleeps All Winter, Little Bear, and
Brother Wolf and the Rock. The American
Indians have given us a varied collection of
animal myths including How the Rabbit Tried
to Coast, How the Squirrel Got Wings, The
Talking Grass, and many other camp fire
tales that have a nature background.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span></p>

<p>The reason for using these animal stories
for story telling and supplementary reading
lies in the instinctive interest which all children
have in those stories that express the interpretation
of life made by primitive races.
This interest, and the indirect moral teaching
of many of the stories included in this
volume, give them a point of departure over
and above that held by the modern story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_EAGLE">HOW THE EAGLE<br>
WENT HUNGRY.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, before there were white
men on the earth, the Beavers were a family
like men. They were thrifty and honest,
and spent their time building in the lakes
and ponds. They had hands like our hands.
They were dressed in gray fur, warm enough
for the winters, and dark enough for all the
digging which they had to do.</p>

<p>There was no family of all the forest so
hard working as the Beavers. The Beaver
men had a secret trade of making arrows.
They dug flint out of the rocks along the
bank and shaped it into arrowheads. These
had such magic that the Beavers always had
dried meat hanging in their houses.</p>

<p>Most wonderful of all, though, was their
skill in building. With no tools but their
broad, flat hands, the Beavers built strong
dams which made pools in the streams where
the fish could hatch. They built their own
homes, with many halls and rooms, of the
mud at the bottom of the water. All the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
Beavers worked, even the women and children.
Here they lived in honesty and peace
and asked nothing of any one.</p>

<p>In the same days the Eagle was a proud
warrior, dressed from head to foot in colored
feathers. He lived on a mountain top, and
when he came down to the forest he wished
great honor. The winds blew their trumpets
for him, and the thunder beat drums. All
the creatures were asked to bow before the
Eagle, and he expected fish and berries to
be brought him for a feast.</p>

<p>One spring when the ice had gone out of
the streams and ponds and the forest had
put on new green leaves, the Eagle came
down for a sudden visit. He stopped at
the edge of a small lake, and there he saw
an old Beaver woman digging in the mud.
She bent low over her work. With her
large, wrinkled hands she was making the
clay into bricks for building a new wall for
a Beaver house. The Eagle looked at her
with scorn.</p>

<p>“I am hungry,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>The Beaver woman raised her brown head
out of the water, and looked up at the Eagle.</p>

<p>“The Beaver family would be hungry,
too, sir,” she said, “if we did not work, all
of us, to get a living.”</p>

<p>“But think of the kind of work you do,”
screamed the Eagle, going up to the branch
of a tree to sit so that he need not step in
the mud.</p>

<p>“Look at your hands,” he went on.
“They are not the hands of a person of
rank, like myself, but are stained with earth.
You live in houses that are made of mud.
You cut down trees with your teeth, and
eat weeds and bark. You were made only
to wait on others such as myself.”</p>

<p>The Beaver woman went on with her
work. When the Eagle had finished, she
said:</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="004" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/004.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“What do you want to eat?” she asked.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“We Beavers are humble, but there are
no other workers in the forest like us. We
deepen and dam the streams and make them
more useful. Our work takes us into the
mud. In the mud we must live, but we are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>honest, thrifty people, sir. What do you
want to eat?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Fish,” said the Eagle. “Go down and
catch some for me.”</p>

<p>The Beaver woman wiped her hands and
then dived down into the water. The Eagle
watched her go, for he was half starved. He
longed for a meal of rich, freshly caught fish.
He watched the smooth water for some time,
but he could see not even a ripple. After
he had waited an hour, the water stirred and
the brown head of the Beaver woman showed.</p>

<p>“Your feast of fish awaits you, O Eagle,”
the Beaver woman said.</p>

<p>“But where are the fish?” the Eagle
demanded.</p>

<p>“They wait for you on my table, down in
the Beaver lodge,” she said, and then she
went under the water again.</p>

<p>The Eagle went hungry for a long time.
Even now, when the Beaver family walks on
four feet, and the Eagle is a bird, all go hungry
who are too proud to work for their food.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LITTLE_FOOTSTEPS">LITTLE FOOTSTEPS<br>
UPON THE WATER.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was a little Indian
boy, and his name was Footsteps Upon the
Water because he could run so fast and so
softly.</p>

<p>One day, little Footsteps Upon the Water
was chasing a squirrel, and he ran so far
and so wide that he lost sight of home,
and he could not find his way back. On
and on ran the squirrel until it came at last
to a hollow tree, and it went inside to
hide. Footsteps Upon the Water went inside,
too, but he was not so small as the squirrel.
Out of the log ran the squirrel, but the little
boy could not get out. He was stuck fast
inside the hollow tree.</p>

<p>His father looked for the little boy many
moons. His mother sat at home in the
wigwam, crying, but Footsteps Upon the
Water did not come back. He lay in the
log, and he pounded and shouted, and he
thought no one was ever coming to let him
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>But one morning, as he rapped, he heard,
on the outside, <em>rap, rap, rap</em>, and a shrill
voice calling:</p>

<p>“Footsteps Upon the Water, are you there?
Are you there?”</p>

<p>Then a wrinkled, brown face, with a
fringe of arrows for a cap, peered in at the
end of the log. It was Grandmother Porcupine
come to help the little boy out.</p>

<p>“I traveled three days and three nights,
little Footsteps Upon the Water, because I
heard you cry,” said Grandmother Porcupine.</p>

<p>Then she scratched and she scratched at
the end of the log, but she could not get the
little boy out.</p>

<p>“I will bring my three grandsons,” said
Grandmother Porcupine, and she hurried
away to the old hemlock tree where her
grandsons lived. She brought them back
with her, and they all scratched at the end
of the hollow log until at last the little boy
was able to crawl out.</p>

<p>Footsteps Upon the Water winked and
blinked his eyes when he came outside, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
he had not seen the sun in many days.
There, in a circle, sat Grandmother Porcupine,
her three grandsons, the old Bear,
the Deer, and the Wolf.</p>

<p>“Now, who will be a mother to this little
boy?” said Grandmother Porcupine; “I am
too old to take care of him.”</p>

<p>“I will be his mother,” said the Wolf.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Grandmother Porcupine,
“your teeth are too sharp.”</p>

<p>“I will be his mother,” said the Deer.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Grandmother Porcupine,
“you are always traveling. Your husband
would carry little Footsteps Upon the
Water on his back wherever he went, and the
little boy would have no home in the winter.”</p>

<p>“I will be his mother,” said the good old
Bear; “I have a warm house in the rocks
with plenty to eat in my pantry,—berries,
and nuts, and honey.”</p>

<p>“You may have little Footsteps Upon the
Water,” said Grandmother Porcupine, “but
be sure that your cubs do not teach him
any rough tricks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>So Footsteps Upon the Water went home
to the Bear’s house, a cave in the rocks, with
little rooms just like a real house. It was a
fine place in which to live.</p>

<p>All summer the little boy played with the
cubs. When it was late in the fall, and the
days were short and dark, and the nights were
cold, Mother Bear tucked them all in bed and
they slept until spring.</p>

<p>Then came another summer, and other
Bear people stopped to call upon them, saying:</p>

<p>“We know a fine berry patch.”</p>

<p>So they would all go away together to
pick strawberries, or blackberries, or gooseberries.
After a while, they went for chestnuts,
and that was the most fun of all.</p>

<p>But Mother Bear taught Footsteps Upon
the Water and the little cubs to run always
when they saw a man with a bow and arrows.
One day, a man came very close to the Bear’s
house, but Mother Bear chased him with a
forked stick, and he went away.</p>

<p>The next day, the man came again, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
as the family was starting out for chestnuts.
Mother Bear threw a bag of feathers
at the man so that he was not able to see,
and he ran away.</p>

<p>The third day, the man came again.
Mother Bear was starting out for a neighbor’s
house with a bundle upon her back. She
chased the man with her forked stick, she
threw some more feathers at him, but it did
no good. The man shot an arrow at Mother
Bear, and she fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, good Mother Bear,” cried little
Footsteps Upon the Water, running out to
help her, “such a cruel man to hurt my
good Mother Bear!”</p>

<p>But the arrow had stuck fast in Mother
Bear’s bundle, and she was not hurt at all.
And the man ran up to little Footsteps Upon
the Water, crying:</p>

<p>“My little lost boy, my little lost boy,”
for it was Footsteps Upon the Water’s own
father.</p>

<p>Then he told Mother Bear how sorry he
was that he had tried to hurt her, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
invited her and all the cubs to come for a
visit to the wigwam.</p>

<p>And little Footsteps Upon the Water went
home, but he never forgot how good old
Mother Bear had been to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STORY_OF">THE STORY OF<br>
LAMBIKIN.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was a wee, wee
Lambikin, and he thought he would go over
the hill to see his granny.</p>

<p>So he frolicked along on his teetery legs,
as happy and frisky as ever a Lambikin in
the spring could be.</p>

<p>But he had not gone very far when he
met a roaring lion, and the lion said:</p>

<p>“Lambikin, I will eat you.”</p>

<p>Then Lambikin could not think what to
do, for he did not wish to be eaten just then.
So he said to the lion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lambikin goes to Grannikin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where fatter he will grow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then you may eat him so.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The lion wanted a very fat lamb to eat,
so he let Lambikin go on his way, but he
said:</p>

<p>“Be sure to come back this way, Lambikin.”</p>

<p>Lambikin frolicked along on his teetery
legs a little farther, when he suddenly saw a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
great vulture, with a huge bill, flying toward
him.</p>

<p>“I will eat you, Lambikin,” said the vulture.</p>

<p>Now Lambikin was not ready to be eaten
yet, so he said to the vulture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lambikin goes to Grannikin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where fatter he will grow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then you may eat him so.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the vulture flew off, but he said to
Lambikin as he went:</p>

<p>“Be sure to come back this way, Lambikin.”</p>

<p>Lambikin frolicked along a little farther
on his teetery legs, when he suddenly saw a
striped tiger coming to meet him, and the
tiger said to him:</p>

<p>“Lambikin, I will eat you.”</p>

<p>Now Lambikin did not wish to be eaten
by a striped tiger, so he said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lambikin goes to Grannikin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where fatter he will grow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then you may eat him so.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The tiger was sure that a fat lamb would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
taste better than a wee, wee one with teetery
legs, so he let Lambikin go along, but
he said as he went:</p>

<p>“Be sure that you come back this way,
Lambikin.”</p>

<p>Lambikin reached his granny’s house, and
he told her how glad he was to see her, and
then he said he was very hungry, and he
would like something to eat.</p>

<p>“I must grow fat, granny,” said Lambikin.</p>

<p>So his granny led the way to the corn
bin, and Lambikin ate and ate and ate until
his sides stuck out, and his legs were not
teetery any more, and he was a fat little
lamb. But the more corn he ate and the
fatter he grew the less did he want to be
eaten. So he said to his granny:</p>

<p>“Grannikin, lion and vulture and tiger
will eat Lambikin. What shall he do?”</p>

<p>Then said his granny:</p>

<p>“I will make a drum of a bit of old skin.
Do you get inside and roll past the lion and
the vulture and the tiger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>So granny made a drum of a bit of skin,
and Lambikin jumped inside the drum, and
off he rolled toward home.</p>

<p>But before he had gone very far he met
the lion, who was waiting for him, and the
lion said:</p>

<p>“Drummikin, have you seen Lambikin?”</p>

<p>But Lambikin called out from inside the
drum:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fallen into the fire, and so will you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">On, little Drummikin, tum, tum, too.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the lion thought the woods must be
on fire, so he ran off as fast as he could.</p>

<p>But Lambikin had not gone very far
when the vulture flew down for his dinner.</p>

<p>“Drummikin, have you seen Lambikin?”
asked the vulture.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fallen into the fire, and so will you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">On, little Drummikin, tum, tum, too,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>said Lambikin in a gruff voice from the inside
of the drum.</p>

<p>Then the vulture thought that the woods
must surely be on fire, so he flew far above
the treetops.</p>
<br>

<p>Lambikin rolled merrily along a little way
farther, but soon he met the striped tiger,
who was waiting for his dinner.</p>

<p>“Drummikin, have you seen Lambikin?”
asked the striped tiger.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fallen into the fire, and so will you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">On, little Drummikin, tum, tum, too,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>said Lambikin; but the striped tiger had
very sharp ears.</p>

<p>“Lambikin is inside Drummikin,” he said,
and he started after the drum as fast as he
could go. He nearly caught it, for he went
so very fast, but they came to a bramble
bush. The tiger caught his tail and was not
able to move, and out of the drum jumped
Lambikin.</p>

<p>Then off he frolicked home again as frisky
and happy as ever a lamb could be.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BROTHER_WOLF">BROTHER WOLF<br>
AND THE ROCK.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time Brother Wolf dressed
himself up very finely, just like an Indian.
He put feathers on his head, and moccasins
on his feet, and beads around his neck.
Then he bought a very gay blanket, just
like a chief’s blanket. He wrapped it all
around him, and then he started on a
journey.</p>

<p>As he traveled, he came to a big Rock.
Brother Wolf thought that he had never
seen such a nice Rock, such a smooth, round,
shining Rock. But Brother Wolf thought
that the Rock looked cold. So he took off
his blanket and wrapped it around the Rock
to keep the old Rock warm.</p>

<p>Then Brother Wolf started traveling again,
but he had not gone very far when he heard
a loud noise—that was the thunder; and
he saw a bright light—that was the lightning;
and he felt something wet on his nose—that
was the rain. So Brother Wolf ran
back in great haste to the Rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Rock,” cried Brother Wolf, “it is
storming, and I shall be wet. Give me back
my blanket to keep off the rain.”</p>

<p>But, no, Rock would not. Old Rock said
he would just keep Brother Wolf’s blanket
a little longer.</p>

<p>Then Brother Wolf hid under a tree, and,
by and by, along came Brother Fox.</p>

<p>“Oh, Brother Fox,” said Brother Wolf,
“go to Rock and bring back my blanket.”</p>

<p>So Brother Fox went to old Rock and
told him that Brother Wolf wanted back
his blanket to keep the rain off his nose.
But, no, old Rock would not give up the
blanket.</p>

<p>Then Brother Fox went back and told
Brother Wolf, and Brother Wolf cried because
he knew his feathers would be spoiled.
They sat under a tree, and the rain poured
and poured, the lightning flashed, and the
thunder roared. Brother Wolf asked Brother
Fox to please go again to old Rock and ask
for the blanket, but Brother Fox said,
“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>After a while they heard a great noise,
and a loud roaring. The stones in the
road began to come skipping by. Brother
Wolf peeped out from under the tree.
There was old Rock rolling down the
road. The rain had started him, and he
was coming so hard that he tore great
furrows of earth, and uprooted the trees.
He came so fast that he could not stop
himself.</p>

<p>Brother Fox scampered into a hole to
hide, but he left the tip end of his tail sticking
out. Old Rock just grazed it as he went
by, and that is why the tip of Brother Fox’s
tail is pointed.</p>

<p>On and on went old Rock until he came
to a river. Splash, in he went, and that
was the last that anybody saw of Rock, for
he went straight to the bottom.</p>

<p>When the rain was over, Brother Wolf
and Brother Fox went down to the river
bank to look for old Rock, but they could
not find him anywhere. On the top of the
water floated Brother Wolf’s gay blanket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
so they waited until it came ashore, and
they dried it in the sun.</p>

<p>Then Brother Wolf said “Good-by” to
Brother Fox, and put on his blanket again,
and traveled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LITTLE_BEAR">LITTLE BEAR.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, there was an Indian
boy and he had a little sister. Now the
little sister was not like an Indian child,
for she was a bear.</p>

<p>Early one morning the boy started out
to seek his fortune, but Little Bear wished
to go too.</p>

<p>“No, no, Little Bear, you cannot go.
You must stay at home and watch the fire,”
said her brother. Then he tied Little Bear
to the door posts that she might not run
away.</p>

<p>He had not gone very far on his journey
when he heard TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP,
in the path behind him. There was Little
Bear following with the door posts on her
back.</p>

<p>“Oh, Little Bear, I told you to stay at
home and watch the fire,” said the boy.</p>

<p>He led Little Bear back, and this time he
tied her to a pine tree.</p>

<p>He had not gone very far when he heard
once more, TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
in the path behind him. There was Little
Bear following with the pine tree on her
back.</p>

<p>“Oh, Little Bear, you must stay at home
and watch the fire,” said the boy.</p>

<p>He led Little Bear back, and this time he
tied her to a rock.</p>

<p>He started on his journey again, but he
had not gone a stone’s throw, when he
heard THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, in
the path behind him. There was Little
Bear following him with the rock on her
back.</p>

<p>“What shall I do with you, Little Bear?”
said the boy. But just then they came to a
wide brook with no bridge to span it.</p>

<p>“How shall I cross?” said the little boy.</p>

<p>Little Bear pushed the rock into the
water. She laid the pine tree across the
rock for a bridge. They both walked across
the brook in safety.</p>

<p>“Well, you may come with me, Little
Bear,” said the boy.</p>

<p>They journeyed for many days until they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
came, at last, to some very dark woods. In
the woods they met Brother Wolf carrying
a candle to light him on his way.</p>

<p>“The sun is lost from the sky,” said
Brother Wolf; “the old squaw pulled it
down.”</p>

<p>“Oho, I can find the sun,” said Little
Bear, “but you must first give me two
lumps of maple sugar.”</p>

<p>Brother Wolf gave Little Bear two lumps
of maple sugar and she hurried along until
she came to the old squaw’s wigwam. The
old squaw was stirring a kettle of rice over
her fire. Little Bear crept up behind her.
Little Bear dropped the two lumps of maple
sugar into the kettle. As the old squaw
stirred, she tasted her rice.</p>

<p>“It is too sweet,” she said; “I must go to
the field for more.”</p>

<p>While she was gone, Little Bear found
the sun, which the old squaw had hid in her
wigwam. Little Bear tossed it back to the
sky again.</p>

<p>When the old squaw came back from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
rice fields and missed her sun, she was very
angry. She looked for it many, many days,
but the clouds hid it from her. Then, one
night, she pulled the moon down, and hid
that away in her wigwam.</p>

<p>So there was no light in the evening.
Brother Wolf lighted his candle again, and
he hurried after the boy and Little Bear,
who had started on their journey again.</p>

<p>“The moon is gone from the sky,” said
Brother Wolf, “the old squaw has pulled it
down.”</p>

<p>“Oho, I can find the moon,” said Little
Bear; “give me two pinches of salt, Brother
Wolf.”</p>

<p>Brother Wolf gave Little Bear two pinches
of salt, and Little Bear crept up to the old
squaw again, and threw the salt in her kettle
of rice.</p>

<p>“The rice is too salty,” said the old squaw,
tasting as she stirred; “I must go to the
field for more.”</p>

<p>While she was gone, Little Bear snatched
the moon from the wigwam, where the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
squaw had hid it, and tossed it up to the
sky again.</p>

<p>Brother Wolf snuffed his candle, for he
did not need it any more, but the old squaw
was very angry. The old squaw ran after
Little Bear. She caught her, and she put
her in a bag, and tied the bag to a tree.
Then she went for her spoon with which to
beat Little Bear.</p>

<p>But while she was gone, Little Bear bit
a hole in the bag with her teeth. She slipped
out. Then she filled the bag with the old
squaw’s pots and pans. When the old squaw
came back, and began beating the bag, she
broke all her dishes.</p>

<p>Then the boy and Little Bear picked up
enough sun gold and moon silver which had
fallen by the road to make them rich for
always. And Little Bear traveled with her
brother wherever he went after that. Was
she not a clever Little Bear?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_PIGS_CAN">HOW THE PIGS CAN<br>
SEE THE WIND.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, Mrs. Pig lived in a fine
house of her own with her five little pigs.
Four of the little pigs were black, but the
smallest pig was white and he was as the
apple of his mother’s eye.</p>

<p>Around the hill from Mrs. Pig’s house
lived Brother Wolf, and Brother Wolf had
a mighty good mouth for pig meat. Every
night Mr. Wolf came through the garden
gate, and he walked round and round Mrs.
Pig’s house, sniffing and snuffing, and calling
in a soft voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mrs. Pig, Mrs. Pig, let me come in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The corn is ripe, and the frosts begin.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Mrs. Pig always locked her door fast,
and Brother Wolf had to go home without
any pig meat.</p>

<p>One night Brother Wolf thought of a
trick. He put a very high hat on his head.
He put shoes on his feet. He tied a necktie
around his neck, and he looked just like Mr.
Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Then he put a bag of corn over his shoulder,
and he walked, TRAMP, TRAMP, up
the brick walk that led to Mrs. Pig’s house,
and he rapped loudly on Mrs. Pig’s door.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mrs. Pig, Mrs. Pig, let me come in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The corn is ripe, and the frosts begin,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>he said.</p>

<p>“Who knocks?” asked Mrs. Pig, peeping
through the window, the little white pig
under her arm.</p>

<p>“Mr. Man, come to put a mark on your
little pigs,” said Brother Wolf.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Pig opened the door, and she
turned out the four little black pigs. But
the little white pig was as the apple of her
eye, and she hid him in the cupboard.</p>

<p>So Brother Wolf emptied all the corn out
of his bag, and he put in the four little pigs,
and he carried them home with him.</p>

<p>By and by, Brother Wolf was hungry for
more pig meat, so he dressed himself in his
clothes again. He put his bag of corn over
his shoulder, and he rapped loudly at Mrs.
Pig’s door, calling:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mrs. Pig, Mrs. Pig, let me come in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The corn is ripe, and the frosts begin.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Who knocks?” asked Mrs. Pig.</p>

<p>“Mr. Man, come to put a mark on your
little white pig,” said Brother Wolf.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Pig barred the door, and locked
the window, and hid the little white pig in
the dresser, for he was as the apple of her
eye.</p>

<p>Then Brother Wolf was very angry, and
he took off his hat and his shoes and his
necktie. He hurried up and down the roads
until he met Mr. Wind, who wore a red
cloak, and was sweeping the fields.</p>

<p>Brother Wolf told Mr. Wind how he had
a mighty good mouth for pig meat. Mr.
Wind said he would help Brother Wolf, for
he always liked a romp.</p>

<p>So Mr. Wind and Brother Wolf went to
Mrs. Pig’s house and they rapped loudly on
the door, and Brother Wolf called out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mrs. Pig, Mrs. Pig, let me come in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The corn is ripe, and the frosts begin.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But never a word did Mrs. Pig say.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="030" style="max-width: 41.5em;">

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“Blow, Mr. Wind,” said Brother Wolf.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Wind began to puff himself out
bigger and bigger. He huffed and he puffed
and he blew a mighty gale. He blew round
the garden, and he pulled up the corn and
threw it down on the ground. He slammed
the gate and he rattled the window. He
shook the door, and he cried, “WHE-EE,
WHE-EE,” in the keyhole, did Mr. Wind.</p>

<p>Brother Wolf was so frightened that his
hair stood up straight on his back. Out of
the garden he ran, and around the hill. He
never stopped, nor looked behind him, and
no one ever saw him in Mrs. Pig’s garden
again.</p>

<p>“WHE-EE, WHE-EE, let me in,” called
Mr. Wind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pig opened her door a crack, and
peeped out with the little white pig under
her arm, for he was the apple of her eye.</p>

<p>HUFF, PUFF, the door blew open wide.
When Mrs. Pig saw Mr. Wind in his red
cloak running around the garden, she hurried
off to the woods with her little white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
pig, and she never came home for a day and
a night.</p>

<p>And that is how the pigs first came to see
the wind. If you do not believe it, just
watch them run when Mr. Wind comes
huffing and puffing through the garden.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TALKING">THE TALKING<br>
GRASS.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time when there were only
Indians and animals in our land, there was
a green hill covered with long talking grass.
The four winds of heaven brought the grasses
news of what was going on in the world, and
of the coming of hunters. Then the grasses
whispered this news to their friends, the little
red Fox, the Hare, the Deer, and the Wolf.
If the animals were too far away to hear
the soft voices of the grasses, they gave the
messages to the Butterflies. The hill was
the refuge of these animals, and the talking
grasses were their friends.</p>

<p>One day a great band of hunters came from
their camp in the valley, up the hill. They
were armed with bows and arrows. They
planned to kill enough game to give them food
for a long time. But the grasses knew that
the hunters were on their way. They warned
the animals, who hid at once. When the
hunters reached the hill, they saw nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
but green grass waving in the wind. Many
bright butterflies flew above it.</p>

<p>The hunters listened and heard the grasses
talking to one another. They saw, too, the
trails of the animals as they had passed
through it. They guessed at once what
had happened.</p>

<p>“The grasses have told the animals to flee
and hide from us,” they said. “We must
kill them. To-night we will rest and sleep
among them, for we are tired with our long
journey. But to-morrow we will tear every
blade of grass up by its roots.”</p>

<p>At these cruel words the grasses became
still. They loved their life on the hill, with
their roots in the earth and their green blades
reaching up to the sunshine. Now they knew
that they were going to die in the morning.
They could neither sing nor talk any more.
But the Butterflies knew the grasses’ peril.
They flew away, one by one, so that the
hunters would suspect nothing, until they
came to the Fox’s den. They told him of
the great danger of the talking grasses. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
begged him to do anything that he could to
save them.</p>

<p>The Fox set off at once. He did not stop
until he came to a dark cave on the side of
a mountain. Here the Fire Manito lived.
Few dared speak to him, for he was a very
mighty Manito. He was able to destroy
man or beast at his will. But when he saw
the eager, trembling little Fox, waiting outside,
the Fire Manito asked him his errand.
The Fox told him that the grasses were to be
killed in the morning, unless something was
done to save them.</p>

<p>The Manito went to the back of his cave
and brought out a heap of black stones.
There was no light in them. He told the
Fox about them.</p>

<p>“They came from the depths of the earth,”
he said. “The Great Spirit mixed a million
sunbeams in each. Then he hid them in
the earth until they should be needed to give
heat and light to man. Now we will use the
black stones to save the grasses.”</p>

<p>The Manito heated the stones in his wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
fire and they glowed like red rubies. He sent
the Fox ahead to tell the grasses to be brave.
He, himself, followed with his arms full of
the glowing stones which did not burn him
because he was the Fire Manito.</p>

<p>The hunters had arisen early and waited
at the foot of the hill, ready to rush up and
tear up the grasses. But the Manito laid
the brightly burning stones in a circle about
the hill. The hunters were not able to get
through. It was a ring of fire and it frightened
them. They had never seen burning
coals before. They went back to their camp
and the grasses were safe, for the coals burned
to ashes without touching them.</p>

<p>The grasses soon found their voices again,
and they have been talking to their friends,
the animals, ever since. In the summer they
tell the Field Mouse and the Hare where to
hide safely. In the spring they tell the Deer
that they are fresh and green for his food.
When it is winter, a few of the grasses stand
up, stiff and tall, above the snow as the
lone gray Wolf runs by. They guide him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
food. In the fall the whispering of the dry
grasses helps the Fox to double his trail so
that no one may catch him.</p>

<p>Who of you have heard the voices of the
grasses?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_FOX">HOW THE FOX<br>
PLAYED HERDSMAN.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was a little old
woman who had a farm of her very own
with sheep, and cows, and swine. But the
little old woman was so busy making butter
and minding the dairy that she had no time
to look after the herds.</p>

<p>One fine morning she started out to hire
a herdsman. Now she had not gone very
far when she met a bear.</p>

<p>“Whither away, Goody?” asked Bruin of
the little old woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am off to engage a herdsman for
my farm,” said Goody in reply.</p>

<p>“Why not hire me, Goody?” asked Bruin.</p>

<p>“Can you call the flocks at evening?”
asked the little old woman.</p>

<p>“You should just hear me,” said Bruin,
and he called in a very loud and gruff
voice, “OW, OW.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I won’t have you,” said the little
old woman as soon as she heard his gruff
voice, and off she went on her way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>She had not gone a day’s journey farther
when she met a wolf.</p>

<p>“Whither away, Goody?” asked the wolf
of the little old woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am off to engage a herdsman for
my farm,” said Goody.</p>

<p>“Why not hire me, Goody?” asked the
wolf.</p>

<p>“Can you call the flocks at evening?”
asked the little old woman.</p>

<p>“You should just hear me,” said the
wolf, and he called in a shrill voice, “UH,
UH.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the little old woman as
soon as she heard that, and off she went on
her way.</p>

<p>But before the end of another day’s
journey, whom should the little old woman
meet but Brother Fox, sitting beside a
blackberry bush, and sunning himself.</p>

<p>“Whither away, Goody?” asked Brother
Fox.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am off to engage a herdsman for
my farm,” said Goody in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Why not hire me, Goody?” said Brother
Fox.</p>

<p>“Can you call the flocks at evening?”
asked the little old woman.</p>

<p>“Ah, you should hear me,” said Brother
Fox. He opened his mouth very wide, and
sang in a sweet voice:</p>

<p>“Tum-ti-ti, tum-ti-ti-tra-la-la.”</p>

<p>“You will do very well,” said the little
old woman, quite carried away with the
fox’s sweet singing. “You shall come home
with me, and be my herdsman.”</p>

<p>Things went very well for a little while
at the farm. Early each morning Brother
Fox led the sheep and the cows and the
swine to pasture, and at night he led them
home again, and locked the barn, and bolted
the pigpen.</p>

<p>But, somehow, after a week, the flocks
and the herds seemed smaller each night
when the little old woman went out to make
the rounds of the farm.</p>

<p>“Where is the small black pig?” she
asked of Brother Fox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Loitering in the meadow,” said Brother
Fox, wiping his mouth with his paw.</p>

<p>“Where is the old ram?” asked the little
old woman.</p>

<p>“He stops behind at the brook,” said
Brother Fox, turning his head away that
Goody might not see him laughing.</p>

<p>So Goody went back to the dairy, and she
wondered and wondered what made the
flocks grow smaller.</p>

<p>At last she had churned enough butter
to make a fine cake and she went out to
the poultry roost for eggs with which to enrich
it.</p>

<p>Alas, such a hubbub, and cackling, and
fussing did she find.</p>

<p>The cock stood on the pump, crying
loudly, “Cock-a-doodle-do.”</p>

<p>The hens ran about cackling, and out of
their midst walked Brother Fox with a

eggs.</p>

<p>And as he went along he sang to all the
poultry yard:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Well, it’s certainly a very poor herdsman
you are,” cried the little old woman.
“Where is the small black pig? Where is
the old ram?”</p>

<p>She ran after Brother Fox, who dropped
his eggs and broke every one, and tipped
over the churn as he passed the dairy. The
little old woman picked up the dasher, and
would have beaten Brother Fox, but he was
too quick for her, and reached the woods,
with a drop of cream on the tip end of his
tail.</p>

<p>So the little old woman learned what had
become of her herds, and Brother Fox was
never able to get that cream from off his
tail, The tip end has been white ever since
he played at being a herdsman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MR_ELEPHANT">MR. ELEPHANT<br>
AND MR. FROG.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, when Mr. Elephant
and Mr. Frog lived together in the same
wood with Mr. Fox and Mr. Tiger and Mr.
Hare and Mr. Lion, the animals were all
very good friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Elephant was very, very big, and Mr.
Frog was very, very little, but every day
they went walking together, Mr. Elephant
going in front, tramp, tramp, tramp; and
Mr. Frog going on behind, hop, hop,
hop.</p>

<p>One night when they came home, Mr.
Hare, who was a saucy little fellow, ran to
meet them, and he said:</p>

<p>“Oho, Mr. Frog says Mr. Elephant is his
horse.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Fox and Mr. Tiger and Mr.
Lion all followed after Mr. Hare, crying:</p>

<p>“Oho, oho, Mr. Elephant is Mr. Frog’s
horse.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elephant turned around, and he said
in a very gruff voice to Mr. Frog:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Did you tell them, grandson, that I was
your horse?”</p>

<p>And Mr. Frog said in a high, squeaky
voice:</p>

<p>“No, no, grandfather.”</p>

<p>But all the time Mr. Frog was thinking
of a trick to play on Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>The next day, Mr. Elephant and Mr.
Frog started off for a long walk. Mr. Frog
had heard of a place where the swamps
were deep and muddy. Mr. Elephant knew
a place where the bananas grew ripe and
thick. And they spent a pleasant day. On
the way home Mr. Frog hopped up close to
Mr. Elephant, and he said in his high,
squeaky voice:</p>

<p>“Grandfather, I have no strength to
walk. Let me get up on your back.”</p>

<p>“Climb up, my grandson,” said Mr. Elephant.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/045.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">And just then they came toward home.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>He put his trunk down for a ladder, and
Mr. Frog climbed up. They had not gone
very far when Mr. Frog hopped up close
to Mr. Elephant’s ear, and he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>
<p>“I am going to fall, grandfather. Give
me some small cords from the roadside that
I may bind your mouth, and hold myself
upon your back.”</p>

<p>“I will, grandson,” said Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>So Mr. Elephant stripped some small
cords from a birch tree by the roadside, and
handed them to Mr. Frog. Then Mr. Frog
bound Mr. Elephant’s mouth, and they went
on a little farther. It was not long, though,
before Mr. Frog spoke again to Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>“Grandfather,” he said, “find me a small,
green twig that I may fan the mosquitoes
from your ears.”</p>

<p>“I will, grandson,” said Mr. Elephant, so
he broke a small, green twig from the birch
tree, and reached it up to Mr. Frog; and
just then they came toward home.</p>

<p>“See Mr. Elephant,” cried Mr. Hare.</p>

<p>“See Mr. Elephant,” cried Mr. Tiger.</p>

<p>“See Mr. Elephant,” cried Mr. Lion and
all the others, “Mr. Elephant is Mr. Frog’s
horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Elephant turned himself about, and
he saw Mr. Frog on his back, holding the
reins and the whip.</p>

<p>“Why, so I am, grandson,” said Mr.
Elephant.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Frog jumped down to the
ground, and he laughed and he laughed
until he nearly split his coat, because he
had played a trick on Mr. Elephant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_DRAKESTAIL">HOW DRAKESTAIL<br>
WENT TO THE<br>
KING.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was a wee little
duck, with a very long tail, so he was called
Drakestail. Now, Drakestail had some
money of his very, very own, and the king
asked if he might take it. So Drakestail
loaned all his money to the king.</p>

<p>But the king kept Drakestail’s money for
a year and a day, and still he did not send
it back. Drakestail said he would go to the
king and bring back the money himself.</p>

<p>So off he started, one very fine morning,
for the king’s house. The sun was shining
on the ponds, and Drakestail waddled along
in the middle of the road, feeling very fine.
As he traveled, he met a fox, and the fox
said, “Where do you go this fine morning,
Friend Drakestail?”</p>

<p>“To the king,” said Drakestail, “for he
owes me money.”</p>

<p>“I will travel along with you,” said the fox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Ah,” said Drakestail, “your four legs
would soon tire. Come along with me this
way,” and he opened his wee little bill very
wide, and down his wee little throat went
the fox.</p>

<p>Then Drakestail traveled on a little farther.
As he went he came to a ladder lying
beside the road.</p>

<p>“Where do you go this fine morning,
Friend Drakestail?” asked the ladder.</p>

<p>“To the king,” said Drakestail, “for he
owes me money.”</p>

<p>“I will travel along with you,” said the
ladder.</p>

<p>“Your wooden legs would soon tire,” said
Drakestail. “Come along with me this
way,” and he opened his little bill very
wide, and down his wee little throat went
the ladder.</p>

<p>Then Drakestail traveled on a bit farther
until he came to his friend, the river, lying
and glistening in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Where do you go this fine morning,
Friend Drakestail?” asked the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“To the king, for he owes me money,”
said Drakestail.</p>

<p>“I will travel with you,” said the river.</p>

<p>“You would soon tire if you ran so far,
my friend,” said Drakestail. “Come along
with me this way.” He opened his wee bill
very wide, and down his wee little throat
went the little river.</p>

<p>Then Drakestail traveled and traveled
until he came to the king’s house. Now
Drakestail thought that the king would
meet him at the gate, so he called out very
loudly:</p>

<p>“<em>Honk! Honk!</em> Drakestail waits at the
gate.”</p>

<p>But the king did not come out to meet
him. Who should appear at the gate but
the king’s cook, and the cook took Drakestail
by his two little legs and flung him into
the poultry yard. The other fowls, who
were ill-bred birds, ran up to Drakestail
and bit him, and jeered at his large tail.
It would have gone very badly with Drakestail,
but he called to his friend, the fox:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Reynard, Reynard, come out to the earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Or Drakestail’s life is of little worth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So the fox came out, and he ate up all the
ill-bred fowls in the king’s poultry yard.
But still Drakestail was badly off. He heard
the king’s cook putting the broth pot over
the fire.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ladder, ladder, come out to the wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Drakestail does not wish to be broth at all,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>he cried. So the ladder came out and leaned
against the wall, and Drakestail climbed
over in safety. But the king’s cook saw
Drakestail and set out after him. He caught
poor Drakestail and clapped him into the
broth pot, and hung him over the fire.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“River, my sweetheart, put out this hot fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The flames that would cook me rise higher and higher,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>cried Drakestail. So the river put out the
fire with a great noise and sputtering, which
the king heard. And the king came running
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Good morning to you, King,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Drakestail, hopping out of the broth pot,
and making a very low bow, “are you
through with my money, which you have
kept for a year and a day?”</p>

<p>“That I am, Drakestail,” said the king.
“You shall have it at once.”</p>

<p>So the king gave Drakestail the money
that he owed him, and Drakestail waddled
home again to tell of all his travels.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_GREEDY_CAT">THE GREEDY CAT.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there lived a cat and
a mouse, and they thought they would ask
each other to dinner, turn and turn about.
First it was the cat’s turn to ask the mouse,
and he set his table and invited her, but he
did not have much to eat; only a dry crust
of bread and some water. But the mouse,
who was very polite, ate it and thanked the
cat.</p>

<p>When it was the mouse’s turn to give a
dinner, she spread a fine feast, platters of
fish, and saucers of milk, and joints of meat.
Then she baked a large cake with sugar on
the top for the cat, and for herself she made
a very tiny cake with no frosting.</p>

<p>The cat came to the mouse’s dinner, and
he ate the fish and the meat, and lapped the
milk, and ate the cake. Then he looked
around in a greedy way, and he said:</p>

<p>“What a very light dinner. Have you
nothing more in the house to eat, mouse?”</p>

<p>“Here is my cake,” said the mouse, who
was not at all greedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>So the cat ate the mouse’s cake, and then
he looked about again in a greedy way,
and he said:</p>

<p>“Have you anything more to eat, mouse?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, kind sir,” said the mouse,
“unless you eat me.”</p>

<p>She thought the cat would never be so
greedy as that, but he opened his mouth
wide, and down his throat went the mouse.</p>

<p>Then the greedy cat walked out of the
mouse’s house and down the road, swinging
his tail, for he felt very fine.</p>

<p>On his way he met an old woman. Now
the old woman had been peeping in at the
window, and she had seen what that greedy
cat had done.</p>

<p>“You greedy cat,” she said, “to eat your
friend, the mouse.”</p>

<p>“Greedy, indeed,” said the cat, “I have a
mind to eat you.”</p>

<p>Then he opened his mouth very wide, and
down his throat went the old woman.</p>

<p>Then on down the road went the cat,
swinging his tail, and feeling finer than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
ever. As he went he met an old man taking
his load of apples to market. The old man
was beating his donkey to make it go
faster.</p>

<p>“Scat, scat, pussy,” said the man, “my
donkey will tread on you.”</p>

<p>“Tread on me, indeed,” said the cat,
shaking his fat sides, “I have eaten my
friend the mouse, I have eaten an old woman.
What is to hinder my eating you?”</p>

<p>So the greedy cat opened his mouth very
wide, and down his throat went the man
and his donkey.</p>

<p>Then he walked along in the middle of
the road again. After a while he spied a
great cloud of dust, and he heard a great
tramping of feet. It was the king riding
in his chariot, and behind him marched all
his soldiers and his elephants.</p>

<p>“Scat, scat, pussy,” said the king, “my
elephants might step on you.”</p>

<p>“Step on me, indeed,” said the cat, “I
have eaten my friend the mouse, I have
eaten an old woman, I have eaten an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
man and a donkey. What is to hinder my
eating a king and a few elephants?”</p>

<p>So the cat opened his mouth wide, and
down his throat went the king and the soldiers
and all the elephants.</p>

<p>Then the cat started on again, but more
slowly. He was really not hungry any
more. As he traveled he met two land
crabs, scuttling along in the dust.</p>

<p>“Scat, scat, pussy,” squeaked the crabs.</p>

<p>“I have eaten my friend the mouse,” said
the cat, “I have eaten an old woman, and a
man and a donkey, and a king and all his
soldiers and all his elephants. What is to
hinder my eating you, too?”</p>

<p>Then the cat opened his mouth wide, and
down his throat went the two crabs.</p>

<p>But the crabs began to look about them
there in the dark. There were the soldiers
trying to form in fours, but there was not
room. The elephants were stepping on each
other’s toes. The old woman was scolding,
and in a corner sat the poor little mouse, her
paws and ears all drooping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“We must go to work,” said the crabs.</p>

<p>Then they began snipping and snipping
with their sharp little claws. Soon there
was a hole large enough, and they crept out.</p>

<p>Then out came the king and his soldiers
and all his elephants. Out came the old
woman scolding her cat. Out came the man
and his donkey. Last of all, out came the
little mouse with one little cake under her
arm, for one cake was all that she had wanted.</p>

<p>But the greedy cat had to spend all the
rest of the day sewing up the hole in his coat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_THREE_BILLY">THE THREE BILLY<br>
GOATS GRUFF.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there were three Billy
Goats, and one was a very large Goat, and
one was a middle-sized Goat, and one was a
tiny Goat, but the three had the very same
name, which was Gruff.</p>

<p>One morning the three Billy Goats started
away from home, for they had decided to go
far, far to a hillside where there was a quantity
of green grass, and they might eat of it
and make themselves fat.</p>

<p>Now, on the way to the hillside there ran
a brook, and over the brook was a bridge,
and under the bridge lived a Troll with eyes
as large as saucers, and a nose as long as a
poker. And this Troll was fond of eating
Billy Goats.</p>

<p>First of all came the youngest Billy Goat
Gruff to cross over the bridge. Trip trap,
trip trap, his little feet pattered upon the
boards.</p>

<p>“Who is that tripping over my bridge?”
called up the Troll in a surly voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only I, the tiniest Billy Goat
Gruff, going over to the hillside to make
myself fat,” the Goat called back in a wee
small voice.</p>

<p>“I am going to gobble you up, Billy Goat
Gruff,” said the Troll.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, pray do not take me,” said the
tiniest Billy Goat Gruff; “I am too little,
that I am. Wait until the second Billy
Goat Gruff comes along. He is ever so
much bigger than I.”</p>

<p>“Well, be off with you,” said the Troll.</p>

<p>Then came the middle-sized Billy Goat
Gruff, to cross the bridge. Trip trap, trip
trap, his middle-sized feet pattered upon
the boards.</p>

<p>“Who is that tripping over my bridge?”
called up the Troll.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only I, the middle-sized Billy
Goat Gruff, going over to the hillside to
make myself fat,” the Goat called back in a
middle-sized voice.</p>

<p>“I am coming to gobble you up, Billy
Goat Gruff,” said the Troll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, pray do not take me,” said the
middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff; “I am a little
larger than the tiniest Billy Goat, but I am
not large enough to make a mouthful for
you. Of that I am quite sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, be off with you,” said the Troll.</p>

<p>Then, last of all, came the great Billy
Goat Gruff, to cross over the bridge.</p>

<p>Trip trap, trip trap, his great feet tramped
across the boards.</p>

<p>“Who is that tramping over my bridge?”
called up the Troll.</p>

<p>“It is I, the great Billy Goat Gruff, going
over to the hillside to make myself fat,” the
Goat called back in a great voice.</p>

<p>“I am coming to gobble you up, Billy
Goat Gruff,” said the Troll.</p>

<p>“Come along,” said the great Billy Goat
Gruff.</p>

<p>So the Troll, whose eyes were as large as
saucers and his nose as long as a poker,
came hurrying up to the top of the bridge,—but,
ah, this is what happened to him.</p>
<br>

<p>There on the bridge stood the great Billy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>Goat Gruff with his feet firmly planted on
the boards and his head lowered, and as
soon as the Troll came near—rush, scamper—the
Goat tossed the Troll so high with his
horns that no one has ever seen a Troll
under a bridge from that day to this.</p>

<p>Then the great Billy Goat Gruff went on
to the hillside, and the three Billy Goats ate,
and ate, and made themselves so fat that
they could scarcely walk home again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HOBYAHS">THE HOBYAHS.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there lived a little old
man and a little old woman in a house all
made of hemp stalks. And they had a little
dog named Turpie who always barked when
any one came near the house.</p>

<p>One night when the little old man and
the little old woman were fast asleep, creep,
creep, through the woods came the Hobyahs,
skipping along on the tips of their toes.</p>

<p>“Tear down the hemp stalks. Eat up
the little old man, and carry away the little
old woman,” cried the Hobyahs.</p>

<p>Then little dog Turpie ran out, barking
loudly, and he frightened the Hobyahs so
that they ran away home again. But the
little old man woke from his dreams, and
he said:</p>

<p>“Little dog Turpie barks so loudly that I
can neither slumber nor sleep. In the morning
I will take off his tail.”</p>

<p>So when it came morning, the little old
man took off little dog Turpie’s tail to cure
him of barking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The second night along came the Hobyahs,
creep, creep through the woods, skipping
along on the tips of their toes, and
they cried:</p>

<p>“Tear down the hemp stalks. Eat the
little old man, and carry away the little old
woman.”</p>

<p>Then the little dog Turpie ran out again,
barking so loudly that he frightened the
Hobyahs, and they ran away home again.</p>

<p>But the little old man tossed in his sleep,
and he said:</p>

<p>“Little dog Turpie barks so loudly that I
can neither slumber nor sleep. In the morning
I will take off his legs.”</p>

<p>So when it came morning, the little old
man took off Turpie’s legs to cure him of
barking.</p>

<p>The third night the Hobyahs came again,
skipping along on the tips of their toes, and
they called out:</p>

<p>“Tear down the hemp stalks. Eat up
the little old man, and carry away the little
old woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Then little dog Turpie barked very loudly,
and he frightened the Hobyahs so that they
ran away home again.</p>

<p>But the little old man heard Turpie, and
he sat up in bed, and he said:</p>

<p>“Little dog Turpie barks so loudly that I
can neither slumber nor sleep. In the morning
I will take off his head.”</p>

<p>So when it came morning, the little old
man took off Turpie’s head, and then Turpie
could not bark any more.</p>

<p>That night the Hobyahs came again, skip-
ping along on the tips of their toes, and
they called out:</p>

<p>“Tear down the hemp stalks. Eat the
little old man, and carry off the little old
woman.”</p>

<p>Now, since little dog Turpie could not
bark any more, there was no one to frighten
the Hobyahs away. They tore down the
hemp stalks, they took the little old woman
away in their bag, but the little old man
they could not get, for he hid himself under
the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Then the Hobyahs hung the bag which
held the little old woman up in their house,
and they poked it with their fingers, and
they cried:</p>

<p>“Look you! Look you!”</p>

<p>But when it came daylight, they went to
sleep, for Hobyahs, you know, sleep all day.</p>

<p>The little old man was very sorry when
he found that the little old woman was
gone. He knew then what a good little
dog Turpie had been to guard the house at
night, so he brought Turpie’s tail, and his
legs, and his head, and gave them back to
him again.</p>

<p>Then Turpie went sniffing and snuffing
along to find the little old woman, and soon
came to the Hobyahs’ house. He heard the
little old woman crying in the bag, and he
saw that the Hobyahs were all fast asleep.
So he went inside.</p>

<p>Then he cut open the bag with his sharp
teeth, and the little old woman hopped out
and ran home; but Turpie got inside the
bag to hide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>When it came night, the Hobyahs woke
up, and they went to the bag, and they poked
it with their long fingers, crying:</p>

<p>“Look you! Look you!”</p>

<p>But out of the bag jumped little dog
Turpie, and he ate every one of the Hobyahs.
And that is why there are not any Hobyahs
now.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was walking across
London Bridge, and I found a penny. So
I bought a little kid. But the kid would
not go. And I saw by the moonlight it was
long past midnight. It was time kid and I
were home an hour and a half ago.</p>

<p>Then I met a staff, and to the staff I
said:</p>

<p>“Staff, staff, drive kid. I see by the

it is long past midnight. It is time kid
and I were home an hour and a half ago.”</p>

<p>But the wind would not put out the fire.</p>

<p>Then I met a tree, and to the tree I
said:</p>

<p>“Tree, stop wind, wind will not put out
torch, torch will not burn staff, staff will
not drive kid. I see by the moonlight it is
long past midnight. It is time kid and I
were home an hour and a half ago.”</p>

<p>But the tree would not.</p>

<p>Then I met a wee mouse, and to the mouse
I said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Mouse, gnaw tree, tree will not stop
wind, wind will not put out torch, torch will
not burn staff, staff will not drive kid.
I see by the moonlight it is long past midnight.
It is time kid and I were home an
hour and a half ago.”</p>

<p>Then the wee, wee mouse began to gnaw
the tree, the tree began to stop the wind,
the wind began to put out the torch, the
torch began to burn the staff, the staff began
to drive the kid, and the kid began
to go.</p>

<p>See by the moonlight it is almost midnight.
But kid and I were home an hour
and a half ago.</p>

CHRISTMAS SONG.</h2>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was an old gray
Pussy and she was down by the waterside
when the trees and ground were white with
snow. And there she saw a wee, wee Robin
Redbreast hopping upon a branch, so Pussy
said to him:</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Robin Redbreast,
this frosty Yuletide weather?”</p>

<p>Then the wee, wee Robin said to the Pussy,
“I am going to the King to sing him a song
this good Yule morning.”</p>

<p>And the gray Pussy replied, “Go not yet.
Come here, Robin Redbreast, and I will let
you see the bonny white necklace I wear
around my neck.”</p>

<p>But the wee, wee Robin said, “No, no,
gray Pussy. You may show the bonny
white necklace that you wear around your
neck to the little mice, but not to me.”</p>

<p>Then off flew the wee, wee Robin until he
came to a wall of turf and there he saw a
greedy Hawk sitting and watching to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>what small birds passed by. And the greedy
Hawk called to him and said, “Where are
you going, Robin Redbreast, this frosty
Yuletide weather?”</p>

<p>Then the wee, wee Robin said to the Hawk,
“I am going to the King to sing him a song
this good Yule morning.”</p>

<p>And the greedy Hawk replied, “Go not
yet. Come here, Robin Redbreast, and I’ll
let you see a bonny green feather that I
wear in my wing.”</p>

<p>But the wee, wee Robin said, “No, no,
greedy Hawk. You have pecked all the
tiny birds but you’ll not peck me.”</p>

<p>Then off flew the wee, wee Robin until he
came to a hollow in the hillside and there he
saw a sly Fox sitting. The sly Fox saw
Robin and called to him, “Where are you
going, Robin Redbreast, this frosty Yuletide
weather?”</p>

<p>Then the wee, wee Robin said to the Fox,
“I am going to the King to sing him a song
this good Yule morning.”</p>

<p>And the sly Fox replied, “Go not yet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Come here, Robin Redbreast, and I will
show you a bonny spot on the tip of my tail.”</p>

<p>But the wee, wee Robin said, “No, no,
sly Fox. You may show the bonny spot on
the tip of your tail to the lambs but not to me.”</p>

<p>Then off flew the wee, wee Robin until he
came to a little shepherd Lad sitting beside
his cot. The little shepherd Lad saw Robin
and called to him, “Where are you going,
Robin Redbreast, this frosty Yuletide
weather?”</p>

<p>Then the wee, wee Robin said to the
shepherd Lad, “I am going to the King to
sing him a song this good Yule morning.”</p>

<p>And the shepherd Lad replied, “Go not
yet. Come here and I will give you some
crumbs from my pouch.”</p>

<p>But the wee, wee Robin said, “No, no,
little shepherd Lad. You caught the goldfinch
but you’ll not catch me.”</p>

<p>Then off flew the wee, wee Robin until he
came to the King, and he sat down upon a
plowshare just outside of the King’s window,
and he sang him a pretty song because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
was such a good Yule morning. The King
was very much pleased indeed and he said
to the Queen, “What shall we give the wee,
wee Robin Redbreast for singing us such a
pretty song?”</p>

<p>The Queen thought and thought and at
last she decided. “I think we will give the
wee, wee Robin Redbreast a wee Wren to be
his wife,” the Queen said to the King.</p>

<p>So the wee, wee Robin Redbreast and the
wee Wren were married and the King, and
the Queen, and all the court, and the whole
countryside danced at their wedding. And
after the wedding the two flew home to the
Robin’s own waterside.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STORY_OF_IBBITY">THE STORY OF<br>
IBBITY.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was a little
brown boy named Ibbity. He lived in a
warm country where there are jungles and
tigers and sandy deserts. Now Ibbity was
always wondering about things, and one
day he said to his mother:</p>

<p>“I wonder, oh, I do wonder what is the
strongest thing in the world.”</p>

<p>But his mother could not tell him, so
Ibbity started off by himself to find out.</p>

<p>He went a long, long way, and at last
he came to a tree. Up the tree climbed
Ibbity and looked abroad over the jungle
and the desert for something very big and
strong. But just then the top of the tree
broke. Bump, down fell little Ibbity to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tree, you are the strongest thing,
are you not?” cried Ibbity, sitting up and
rubbing his head. “You are able to throw
Ibbity to the ground.”</p>

<p>“No, I am not as strong as the wind,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
sighed the tree, “it was the wind that broke
my branch.”</p>

<p>Then Ibbity ran far away to the place
where the wind was blowing the sand in the
desert, and he said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Wind, the tree threw Ibbity, but you
broke the tree. Are you not the strongest
one?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not the strongest one,” said the
wind, “the hill is able to stop my blowing.”</p>

<p>So Ibbity ran on and on, until he came to
a high hill, and to the hill he said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Hill, the tree threw Ibbity, and the
wind broke the tree, but you are able to
stop the wind. Are you not the strongest
one?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said the hill. “At my feet lives
a small mouse. She is cutting a tunnel
straight through me.”</p>

<p>So Ibbity went down the hill, and looked
around in the bushes until he found a small
brown mouse. To the mouse he said:</p>

<p>“O Mouse, the tree threw Ibbity, the wind
broke the tree, and the hill can stop the wind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
but you have dug a tunnel through the hill.
Are you not the strongest one?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the mouse. “Cannot the tiger
catch me?”</p>

<p>So Ibbity traveled to the jungle, where
the tiger lives, and he said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Tiger, the tree threw Ibbity, the
wind broke the tree, the hill is able to stop
the wind, and the mouse has dug a tunnel
through the hill, but you can catch the
mouse. Are you not the strongest one?”</p>

<p>But the tiger was caught fast in a net,
and he said to Ibbity:</p>

<p>“No, this rope is stronger than I.”</p>

<p>And Ibbity said to the rope:</p>

<p>“Oh, Rope, the tree threw Ibbity, the
wind broke the tree, the hill can stop the
wind, the mouse has dug a tunnel under
the hill, the tiger is able to catch the mouse,
but you have caught the tiger. Are you
not the strongest one?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the rope, “for the fire burns me.”</p>

<p>So Ibbity ran and ran until he came to a
fire, and to the fire he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Fire, the tree threw Ibbity, the wind
broke the tree, the hill stops the wind, the
mouse tunnels the hill, the tiger catches the
mouse, the rope catches the tiger, but you
are able to burn the rope. Are you not the
strongest one?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the fire, “my heat is less than
that of the great sun.”</p>

<p>Then Ibbity looked up at the sky, and he
called loudly to the sun:</p>

<p>“Oh, great Sun, the tree threw Ibbity,
the wind broke the tree, the hill stops the
wind, the mouse tunnels the hill, the tiger
catches the mouse, the rope catches the
tiger, the fire burns the rope, but your heat
is greater than that of the fire. Are you
not the strongest one?”</p>

<p>Then the sun winked its large yellow eye
at Ibbity, and never a word did it say, for it
was too far off to hear Ibbity’s little voice.</p>

<p>So Ibbity clapped his hands and cried, “I
have found the strongest one. It is the sun.”</p>

<p>And little Ibbity went home again to tell
his mother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CHIPMUNK">THE CHIPMUNK<br>
WHO CHATTERED<br>
TOO MUCH.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, when Indians and
animals lived together in the same forest
and animals could speak, the Chipmunk
was the greatest talker of them all.</p>

<p>He lived in a lodge in the middle of the
woods with his grandfather who was very
old and wise as well. But the Chipmunk
was young, and very daring. He was able
to run so fast and climb trees, and jump
from one branch to another that he thought
nothing in the world could harm him. He
had a louder voice then than he has now.
He chattered all day long, boasting about
himself. At last he became very tiresome
to the other animals.</p>

<p>They came at last and spoke to the Chipmunk’s
grandfather about him.</p>

<p>“Your grandson chatters so loudly,”
scolded the Blue Jay, “that the birds are not
able to hear me when I warn them of danger
in the forest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>And the Frog came to the Chipmunk’s
grandfather with tears in his eyes. “Your
grandson chatters so loudly,” croaked the
Frog, “that no one can hear me when I sing
on the edge of the stream in the evening.”</p>

<p>It was quite true. The Chipmunk talked
and boasted all the time. He chattered as
he started out from his lodge in the morning
and all the way down the path to let every
one know that he was on his way. He
chattered when he came to a nut tree and
when he picked up some nuts. He had
pockets in his cheeks, so he could chatter
even when he came home with a mouthful
of nuts. There seemed to be no way of keeping
this young Chipmunk quiet, and at last
his grandfather decided to speak to him about
it.</p>

<p>“You are not using your voice as it was
meant that you should, my son,” said the
Chipmunk’s grandfather. “All the creatures
in feathers and fur in the forest speak
for a reason. The Ground Hog whistles to
call his young, and the Frog croaks when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
wild beasts creep toward the lodges, and the
Robin sings of rain. But you, my son,
chatter for no reason except your foolish
pride. Beware! the Great Chief will hear
you and catch you some day if you do not
stop!”</p>

<p>The Chipmunk thought that night of
what his grandfather had said. But when
morning came, he forgot all about it and
took his noisy way through the woods again.
He made just as much noise as he could, even
after he had reached a hickory-nut tree, and
climbed up among the branches.</p>

<p>Suddenly, though, he was still. He heard
the leaves on the ground rustle and the twigs
crackle with heavy footsteps. Peering down
between the branches, the Chipmunk saw
the Great Chief of whom his grandfather
had warned him. He looked as tall as a
young tree and as dark as a thunder cloud.
He carried a long bow and a quiver of arrows.
He had come for the Chipmunk, and he
waited under the tree, looking up among the
branches to see when he should come down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>But the leaves on the branches hid the
Chipmunk. He gathered a handful of nuts
and tossed them down. The Great Chief
was thrown off his guard by the trick. He
jumped, thinking it was the Chipmunk, but
the little fellow scampered down the other
side of the tree. He got home to his lodge
in safety.</p>

<p>The next day the Chipmunk was even
more noisy than ever as he started out. He
reached a tree, climbed up in it, and again
the Great Chief came with his bow and
arrows to kill the chattering little pest. But
the Chipmunk gathered a handful of twigs
which he threw down at the feet of the Great
Chief.</p>

<p>“Here I come,” the Chipmunk chattered.
As the Great Chief watched to see him follow
the twigs he dropped down on the other side
of the tree and once more reached home safe.</p>

<p>When the Chipmunk started out the third
morning he had a great piece of news to tell
the whole world. He told it just as loudly
as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“The Great Chief can’t catch me. He
can’t catch me,” boasted the Chipmunk.</p>

<p>He kept on chattering this after he had
scampered up a tree, and a very bold plan
entered his head.</p>

<p>The Great Chief came at last. He strode
angrily until he came to the tree where the
Chipmunk sat looking down at him.</p>

<p>“Come down! Come down from this
tree!” called the Great Chief in a loud
voice.</p>

<p>That was just what the Chipmunk planned
to do. He was going to come down and dare
the Great Chief to catch him. He felt that
he would be safe in doing this. So the Chipmunk
came down and stood a second, chattering
to the Great Chief, who was so surprised
that he did not move at first.</p>

<p>Then the Chipmunk ran and the Great
Chief ran after him. It was a race for life,
the Chipmunk soon found out, for the Great
Chief gained at every step. The Chipmunk
leaped and jumped, and panted for breath.
On, and on they went, in and out among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
trees. The Chipmunk lost his loud voice
in fear and no other member of the family
has had such a loud one since that day. He
could see his lodge with his grandfather waiting
for him in the door, but it did not seem
possible that he could reach it.</p>

<p>Oh, there he was at the door; but just as
he went inside the Great Chief took hold of
the Chipmunk with his strong fingers. Although
the Chipmunk pulled himself loose,
he had a row of long white stripes on his back
where the Great Chief had clutched him.</p>

<p>And every other Chipmunk, since then,
has had white stripes on his back, because
of the first Chipmunk who chattered too
much.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_SQUIRREL">HOW THE SQUIRREL<br>
GOT WINGS.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time the Indians tell us that
the Manito was the good spirit of the woods.
He taught every wild creature, bird, beast,
or fish its own special work. It was then
that the Beaver learned how to be a mason,
and the Oriole to be a weaver. The Mole
learned how to dig long, secret tunnels
although he was blind. The Spider was
taught to spin and the Bee to make honey.</p>

<p>Then, too, the Manito made the Squirrel
the little harvester of the woods, gathering
nuts in the fall and digging holes in the earth
in which to bury them for the winter. It
was planned that the Squirrel should be an
example to man of the wisdom of working
while others feasted. He gathered food for
the days when the wind would howl and the
snow drift about his lodge. So the Squirrel
spent his days looking for nuts and laying
them away for cold weather. With him
went his friend, the Woodchuck.</p>

<p>In those days, the Woodchuck ate nuts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
and as his legs were short and his feet flat
he could not climb trees. His feet were
shaped like shovels. He used them for
digging himself a little house in the side of a
hill where he planned to sleep through the
winter until spring should come. But he
was very fond of nuts. His friend, the
Squirrel, was good enough to take him about
the woods and show him the places where
nuts were scattered on the ground. The
Squirrel gave him half of all the nuts there
were. The Woodchuck cracked these with
his sharp teeth and ate them all.</p>

<p>The Manito was apt to walk through the
forest at night to see if everything was safe.
He wished, too, to see if his little wild children
had done their work during the day.
One evening in the late fall the Manito went
through the forest in the form of a night
wind. He looked in the door of the Woodchuck’s
house in the side of the hill. It
was empty!</p>

<p>Taking his way through the trees the
Manito saw a little creature in a gray fur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
blanket creeping softly along from one spot
to another. He had short legs, and feet
shaped like shovels. It was the Woodchuck.
As he came to a place for which he had been
looking, the Woodchuck would dig deep down
in the earth with his paws. He would bring
up a store of nuts and carry them back to his
hole in the side of the hill.</p>

<p>“This is not as it should be,” the Manito
thought. “I did not plan that my son, the
Woodchuck, should harvest at night. Nor
did I decree that he should gather nuts.”</p>

<p>Then it came to the mind of the Manito
what the Woodchuck was up to!</p>

<p>The next night the Manito had a council
fire in the woods and bade all the wild creatures
to come to it. He, himself, dressed
in fine blankets and feathers like an Indian
Chief, sat on a rock before the fire. All
his sons, the Squirrel, the Beaver, the Wolf,
the Deer, the Otter, the Fox, and the rest,
sat in a circle around the fire. There was
one vacant place, though. The Woodchuck
had not yet come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>At the time for the council to open, the
Manito stood up and spoke.</p>

<p>“We are gathered here as a court of law,”
he said. “I have learned that my thrifty
son, the Squirrel, has been the victim of a
thief. He has been busy and saving, as I
have taught him to be. He has done his
harvesting for the winter. But while he
slept a friend robbed him of his nuts. What
shall we do to such a false friend?”</p>

<p>“Drown him!” said the Beaver.</p>

<p>“Starve him!” said the Otter.</p>

<p>“Eat him!” barked the Fox and the
Wolf.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked the gentle Deer.</p>

<p>Just then the Woodchuck tried to slip into
his place in the circle without being seen.
He had a nut in his mouth so that every one
knew at once that he was the thief. He
was the false friend of the thrifty Squirrel!
The animals rose in a body and would have
torn the Woodchuck to pieces at once, or
thrown him into the fire. But the Manito
raised his hand to quiet them. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
called the Woodchuck and the Squirrel to
come to his side.</p>

<p>“I gave you a place to harvest, in the corn
field,” the Manito said to the Woodchuck.
“And I gave you a friend who was good
enough to share his nuts with you because
you are so fond of them. You have disobeyed
me, and stolen from your friend. As
a punishment I will take out your sharp
teeth so that you can never crack a nutshell
again. You shall have grinding teeth,
for eating only corn.”</p>

<p>Then the Manito asked the Squirrel to
come closer to him, and he fitted a pair of
wings to his back. “These wings are a
reward for your industry,” he said, “and to
help you gather another harvest in place of
that which the Woodchuck stole from you.”</p>

<p>From the night of that council fire to the
present time the Woodchuck has eaten only
grains and vegetables. And there have been
flying squirrels because of the first Woodchuck
who stole from his friend.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THEY">HOW THEY<br>
BROUGHT HAIRLOCK<br>
HOME.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, at the foot of a hill,
there lived little Boots and his mother and
their nanny goat, who was named Hairlock.
Now Hairlock loved to run away over the
hill to the mountain, and she could never
be found when milking time came at night.</p>

<p>One day Boots was ready with his pail
and his milking stool, and he called, “Hairlock,
Hairlock, come home to Boots,” but
Hairlock did not come.</p>

<p>Then Boots’s mother climbed to the top
of the hill, and she looked, and she looked,
and there she spied Hairlock on the top of
a crag, a long way off.</p>

<p>“Naughty Hairlock,” she cried, “come
home to Boots. Boots, run to Reynard, the
fox, and tell him to bite Hairlock.”</p>

<p>So Boots ran to Reynard, the fox, and he
said:</p>

<p>“Good Reynard, bite my nanny goat,
Hairlock, who stands on the top of yonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
crag, and will not come home to be
milked.”</p>

<p>But Reynard said, “Not I, Boots; I’ll not
dull my teeth on old Hairlock’s skin, for
I hunt to-night. Another time, Boots, another
time.”</p>

<p>And Boots went back and told his mother
what Reynard had said.</p>

<p>“Then go to Greylegs, the wolf, Boots,”
said his mother, “and tell him to bark at
naughty Hairlock.”</p>

<p>So Boots ran to Greylegs the wolf, and
he said:</p>

<p>“Good Greylegs, bark at my nanny goat,
Hairlock, who stands on the top of yonder
crag, and will not come home to be milked.”</p>

<p>But Greylegs said, “Some other time, Boots,
some other time. The night is cold. I must
stay at home and sleep and cover my cubs.”</p>

<p>And Boots went back and told his mother
what Greylegs had said.</p>

<p>“Then go to Bruin, the bear,” said his
mother, “and bid him chase naughty Hairlock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>So Boots ran to Bruin, the bear, and he
said:</p>

<p>“Good Bruin, chase my nanny goat, Hairlock,
who stands on the top of yonder crag,
and will not come home to be milked.”</p>

<p>But Bruin said, “Ah, Boots, I am much
too fat to chase Hairlock. Go to the fir
tree and ask him to trap Hairlock.”</p>

<p>So Boots ran to the fir tree, and he said:</p>

<p>“Good Fir Tree, trap my nanny goat,
Hairlock, who stands on the top of yonder
crag, and will not come home to be milked.”</p>

<p>But the fir tree only bent and swayed in
the wind, and said, “Ask the woodcutter to
fell me, Boots.”</p>

<p>So Boots ran to the woodcutter, and he
said:</p>

<p>“Good Woodcutter, fell the fir tree, that
he may trap my nanny goat, Hairlock, who
stands at the top of yonder crag, and will
not come home to be milked.”</p>

<p>But the woodcutter said, “Ask the joiner
if he will buy my wood, Boots.”</p>

<p>So Boots went to the joiner, and he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Good Joiner, will you buy wood from
the woodcutter, that he may fell the fir
tree? Then the fir tree will trap my nanny
goat, Hairlock, who stands at the top of
yonder crag and will not come home to be
milked.”</p>

<p>“That I will, Boots,” said the joiner.</p>

<p>Then the woodcutter felled the fir tree
and gave the wood to the joiner. The joiner
took the wood and made a strong yoke,
which he gave to Boots.</p>

<p>Then Boots and his mother ran to the
top of the crag and put the yoke on Hairlock.</p>

<p>And that is how they brought Hairlock
home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BEAR_WHO">THE BEAR WHO<br>
LOST HIS SUPPER.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time old Mother Red Cap
was out walking in the forest and she came
to a wild cherry tree, the branches of which
hung low with cherries. She climbed up
the tree to pick her apron full of cherries when
along came Bruin, the Bear, walking under
the tree. He looked up among the branches
and there he saw old Mother Red Cap.</p>

<p>“Come down, Mother,” he growled, “that
I may eat you.” Old Mother Red Cap did
not want to be eaten by Bruin, the Bear,
so she thought, and thought, and then she
said:</p>

<p>“You do not want to eat an old woman
like me. I will throw you down my shoe
and you may gnaw upon that until I can
come down to the ground and lead you to my
house. I have two little kids there who will
make you a savory meal. Have patience,
Bruin, until I can climb down.”</p>

<p>This was what old Mother Red Cap said,
and she threw down her shoe. Bruin gnawed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and gnawed upon the shoe, but he found it
very dry eating, so he grew angry. He called
up the tree to old Mother Red Cap:</p>

<p>“Come down, Mother, that I may eat you.”</p>

<p>“Just wait a little longer, Bruin, until I
have gathered a few more cherries,” said
she, and she threw down her other shoe.
“Gnaw on this,” she said, “and I will climb
down in a few minutes and show you the
way to my house.”</p>

<p>Bruin gnawed upon the second shoe but
he found it no better than the first. But he
contented himself with the thought of the
two little kids that he would soon be eating,
and he waited beneath the tree until old
Mother Red Cap climbed down.</p>

<p>Down she came, with her apron full of
cherries; home she went, and Bruin tramped
along behind her. When they reached her
house, old Mother Red Cap took Bruin, the
Bear, out to the barn and showed him the two
little kids. He was in a great hurry to get
his paws around them, but, “Wait,” said
Old Mother Red Cap. “First I must give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the two little kids a fine supper that they
may be fatter. Go back to the forest for
the night and return in the morning. Then
the two little kids will be fat enough for
you to eat.”</p>

<p>So Bruin, the Bear, went back to the forest
for the night. Old Mother Red Cap gave
the two little kids a fine, large supper and
then she locked the door of the barn and
went to bed. Very early in the morning she
went out to the barn and unlocked the door
and let out the two fat little kids. They
scampered off to pasture and were soon so
far away that neither hide nor hoof of them
could be seen. Then old Mother Red Cap
locked the door of the barn again.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the sun was up, Bruin,
the Bear, tramped back from the forest,
growling:</p>

<p>“Open the barn door, Mother, that I may
eat the two little kids.”</p>

<p>Mother Red Cap stooped down to peep
through the key hole of the barn door.
Then she shook her head sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“What a pity it is,” sighed old Mother
Red Cap, “that the two little kids are gone.
Can it be that my two mischievous little
grandchildren, Janko and Mirko, unlocked
the door and let the kids out?”</p>

<p>At that Bruin, the Bear, was very angry.
“Then I must eat your two little grandchildren,
Janko and Mirko,” he growled.</p>

<p>This frightened old Mother Red Cap
greatly. She thought and thought, and then
she said: “My two little grandchildren,
Janko and Mirko, are very thin indeed. I
must give them three fine meals or they will
not be fat enough for you to eat. In the
meantime, do you run about through the
forest to get yourself a better appetite.”</p>

<p>So Bruin, the Bear, went away and ran
about in the woods all the rest of the day.
When it was evening he came back with a
fine appetite and rapped at the door of old
Mother Red Cap’s house.</p>

<p>“Send out Janko and Mirko,” he growled,
“and see what short work I will make of
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“Oho, I’ll not do that,” laughed old
Mother Red Cap from inside the house.
“You are too late, Bruin. Janko has just
bolted the door so fast that you will not be
able to open it and I have put Mirko to bed,
where he is fast asleep. You must go back
to the forest and come some other day.”</p>

<p>So Bruin, the Bear, saw that old Mother
Red Cap had got the best of him and he
went back to the forest, hungry, to look for
his supper there.</p>

WAS AFRAID.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, a very long way from
here, a little wild Rabbit sat under a tall
palm tree. All about him were other tall
palm trees and larger animals than he, and
the wild rabbit thought and thought. And
after the Rabbit had thought a while he said
to himself, “What if the earth should crack
and swallow me up.”</p>

<p>Just then the wind blew a cocoanut down
from a tree and it fell upon the ground right
beside the little wild Rabbit. Up he jumped
in great fear for now he was sure that what
he had dreaded was happening.</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
and off he hopped as fast as he could, never
stopping to try and find out what it was that
had made the noise.</p>

<p>As he ran he met his Mother and she said
to him, “Why do you run so fast?”</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
“and I run that I may not be swallowed up
by it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>On ran the Rabbit, and his Mother ran
with him.</p>

<p>As they ran, they met his Father and he
said to the Rabbit, “Why do you run so
fast?”</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
“and we run that we may not be swallowed
up by it.”</p>

<p>On ran the Rabbit and his Mother, and
his Father ran with them.</p>

<p>As they ran they met an Elephant, and
he said to the Rabbit, “Why do you run so
fast?”</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
“and we run that we may not be swallowed
up by it.”</p>

<p>On ran the Rabbit and his Mother and his
Father, and the Elephant ran with them.</p>

<p>As they ran they passed a Deer. “Why
do you run so fast?” he asked of the
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
“and we run that we may not be swallowed
up by it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>On ran the Rabbit and his Mother and his
Father and the Elephant, and the Deer
ran with them.</p>

<p>As they ran they met a Fox. “Why do
you run so fast?” the Fox asked of the
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
“and we run that we may not be swallowed
up by it.”</p>

<p>On ran the Rabbit and his Mother and
his Father and the Elephant and the Deer,
and the Fox ran with them.</p>

<p>As they ran they met all his Relations,
and they said to the Rabbit, “Why do you
run so fast?”</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
“and we run that we may not be swallowed
up by it.”</p>

<p>On ran the Rabbit and his Mother and his
Father and the Elephant and the Deer and
the Fox, and a hundred of his Relations
ran with him.</p>

<p>As they ran they came upon the Lion,
who is the king of the beasts, and the Lion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
said to the Rabbit, “Why do you run so
fast?”</p>

<p>“The earth is cracking,” said the Rabbit,
“and we run that we may not be swallowed
up by it.”</p>

<p>But the Lion, who is the king of the beasts,
did not run. He spoke again. “Which one
of you is it who saw the earth cracking?”
he asked, because he felt sure that there must
be some mistake about it.</p>

<p>“It was not I, O King,” replied the Elephant.</p>

<p>“Nor was it I, O King,” said the Deer
and the Fox and each of the Rabbit’s hundred
Relations and his Father and his Mother,
until all had spoken except the Rabbit
himself.</p>

<p>“Is it true that the earth is cracking?”
asked the Lion of the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“It is true, O King,” replied the Rabbit.
“I sat under a palm tree thinking of what
would happen to me if the earth were to
break up. Suddenly I heard a loud noise
as it cracked.”</p>
<br>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Then we must go back and see how wide
the crack is,” said the Lion. “Rabbit, jump
upon my back and show me the way.”</p>

<p>So the Rabbit jumped upon the Lion’s
back and away they went as fast as the wind,
while the other animals all waited for them.
The Rabbit guided the Lion to the place
where he had sat beneath the palm tree, and
the Lion saw the cocoanut lying on the
ground.</p>

<p>“What a foolish Rabbit you are!” said
the Lion, who is king of all the beasts. Then
he went back to the other beasts and told
them that the earth had not yet cracked.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the Lion they might
all have been running until to-day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_MAPLE_SUGAR">HOW MAPLE SUGAR<br>
CAME.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was a little Indian
boy named Son-of-a-Brave. He was very
fond indeed of going to the lodge of the
village medicine man. Here he listened to
all the wise stories that the medicine man
told about the forest.</p>

<p>This medicine man was very much thought
of by the Indians and they had made him
the best lodge in the village. It stood in
that part of the forest where the trees were
stately, and old, and straight. The lodge,
itself, was covered with the most valuable
skins. It was filled with gifts of beads, and
drums, and arrow heads, and blankets with
pictures woven in them.</p>

<p>Son-of-a-Brave used to gather some of the
herbs that the medicine man brewed. In
return, the Indian boy was allowed to sit
inside the lodge, beside the medicine man’s
kettle, and listen to his sayings.</p>

<p>“The Indians have something to learn
from every beast, and fish, and bird of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the forest,” the medicine man said one
day.</p>

<p>Son-of-a-Brave felt very proud, because
his father was one of the big chiefs of the
tribe. He was proud, too, that he, twelve
years old, could shoot an arrow as straight
as the young braves. So he found it hard to
understand the medicine man.</p>

<p>“What does the clumsy Bear teach us?”
Son-of-a-Brave asked.</p>

<p>“The value of sleep,” replied the medicine
man. “You like to sit up late at
night, listening to the talk of your parents
around the camp fire. In the morning
you have dull eyes and heavy limbs. The
Bear comes out from her winter sleep
ready to rule the den and fight the whole
forest.”</p>

<p>“Well, what does the silly Salmon that
hurls himself down the rapids teach us?”
asked Son-of-a-Brave.</p>

<p>“The greatest lesson of all—that home
is the best place,” replied the medicine man.
“The Salmon swims far away from home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
but always comes back to the hatching
ground through the rapids.”</p>

<p>As Son-of-a-Brave went out through the
lodge he was thinking very hard. There
had been one question that he had wanted to
ask the medicine man, but he had not dared,
Of what use was the great stupid Woodpecker
that flew from tree to tree? It ran
up and down the trunks like a senseless bird,
and pounded like a drum with its huge bill.</p>

<p>There was a Woodpecker now. Son-of-a-Brave
could see it, head down, on the trunk
of a tree, making a hole. It wore a bright
red cap, and its black eyes were as bright
as those of an Indian. Its big black claws
looked like hands. The boy stopped to
watch the odd bird. The Woodpecker bored
awhile, standing on its head. Then it
righted itself and made the hole larger.
Last, it put its bill in the hole and pulling
it out, tipped its head back as if it were
drinking. This was very strange.</p>

<p>When the Woodpecker flew away, Son-of-a-Brave
went up to the tree, for he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
curious about it. It was still too early in
the spring for the tree to have leaves. There
was a little snow left on the ground. But
the boy knew what kind of tree it was by
its bark. He could find others like it all
through the woods. He had a very sharp
arrow head stuck in his belt. He took it
out and began chipping the hole in the tree
trunk which the Woodpecker had started,
until it was larger. To the Indian boy’s
surprise thin sap began to run out of the tree.
He put his lips to the hole.</p>

<p>It was sweet sap—as sweet as wild honey!</p>

<p>Son-of-a-Brave stripped some bark from
the tree and made a little cup. He filled
this with the sweet sap and ran from one
lodge to another in the village, asking the
braves to taste it. They all said that the
sweet sap was good. All the village followed
Son-of-a-Brave back to the forest, while he
pointed out trees like the one which the
Woodpecker had tapped. They bored holes
in them, and from each there flowed the first
maple syrup. It proved that the medicine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
man had been right. Even the Woodpecker,
who worked upside down, could teach the
Indians something.</p>

<p>So the Indians tell us how maple sugar
came. But the story tells us also the great
wisdom of our little wild brothers in feathers
and fur.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_RABBIT_WHO_wanted">THE RABBIT WHO<br>
WANTED RED<br>
WINGS.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time there was a little white
Rabbit with two beautiful long pink ears,
and two bright red eyes, and four soft little
feet—<em>such</em> a pretty little white Rabbit,
but he was not happy.</p>

<p>Just think, this little white Rabbit wanted
to be somebody else instead of a rabbit!</p>

<p>When Mr. Bushy Tail, the gray squirrel,
went by, the little white Rabbit would say
to his Mammy:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mammy, I wish I had a long gray
tail like Mr. Bushy Tail’s.”</p>

<p>And when Mr. Porcupine went by, the little
white Rabbit would say to his Mammy:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mammy, I wish I had a back full of
bristles like Mr. Porcupine’s.”</p>

<p>And when Miss Puddle-Duck went by in
her two little red rubbers, the little white
Rabbit would say:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mammy, I wish I had a pair of red
rubbers like Miss Puddle-Duck’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>So he went on and on wishing until his
Mammy was all tired out with his wishing
and Old Mr. Ground Hog heard him one day.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Ground Hog is very wise indeed,
so he said to the little white Rabbit:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go down to the Wishing
Pond? If you look in the water at yourself
and turn around three times in a circle
you will get your wish.”</p>

<p>So the little white Rabbit went off, all
alone by himself, through the woods until
he came to a little pool of green water lying
in a low tree stump. That was the Wishing
Pond. There was a little, little bird, all red,
sitting on the edge of the Wishing Pond to
get a drink, and as soon as the little white
Rabbit saw him he began to wish again.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I had a pair of little red
wings!” he said. Just then he looked in
the Wishing Pond and he saw his little
white face. Then he turned around three
times and something happened. He began
to have a queer feeling in his shoulders,
like the feeling in his mouth when he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
cutting his teeth. It was his wings coming
through. So he sat all day in the woods by
the Wishing Pond waiting for them to grow,
and by and by, when it was almost sundown,
he started home to see his Mammy and show
her. He had a beautiful pair of long, trailing
red wings.</p>

<p>But by the time he reached home it was
getting dark. When he went in the hole
at the foot of the big tree where he lived, his
Mammy didn’t know him. No, she really
and truly did not know him, because she
had never seen a rabbit with red wings in
all her life. And so the little white Rabbit
had to go out again, because his Mammy
wouldn’t let him get into his own bed. He
had to go out and look for some place to
sleep all night.</p>

<p>He went and went until he came to Mr.
Bushy Tail’s house, and he rapped on the
door and said:</p>

<p>“Please, kind Mr. Bushy Tail, may I
sleep in your house all night?”</p>

<p>But Mr. Bushy Tail opened his door a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
crack and then he slammed it tight shut
again. You see he had never seen a rabbit
with red wings in all his life.</p>

<p>So the little white Rabbit went and went
until he came to Miss Puddle-Duck’s nest
down by the marsh, and he said:</p>

<p>“Please, kind Miss Puddle-Duck, may I
sleep in your nest all night?”</p>

<p>Miss Puddle-Duck poked her head up
out of her nest just a little way. Then she
shut her eyes and stretched her wings out so
far that she covered her whole nest.</p>

<p>You see she had never seen a white rabbit
with red wings in all her life.</p>

<p>So the little white Rabbit went and went
until he came to Old Mr. Ground Hog’s
hole and Old Mr. Ground Hog let him sleep
with him all night, but the hole had beech
nuts spread all over it. Old Mr. Ground
Hog liked to sleep on them, but they hurt
the little white Rabbit’s feet and made him
very uncomfortable before morning.</p>

<p>When it came morning, the little white
Rabbit decided to try his wings and fly a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
little. He climbed up on a hill, and spread
his wings, and sailed off, but he landed in
a low bush all full of prickles. There his
four feet got mixed up with the twigs so he
couldn’t get down.</p>

<p>“Mammy, Mammy, Mammy, come and
help me!” he called.</p>

<p>His Mammy didn’t hear him, but old Mr.
Ground Hog did. He came and helped the
little white Rabbit out of the prickly bush.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want your red wings?” Mr.
Ground Hog asked.</p>

<p>“No, <em>no</em>!” said the little white Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Old Ground Hog, “why
don’t you go down to the Wishing Pond
and wish them <em>off</em> again?”</p>

<p>So the little white Rabbit went down to
the Wishing Pond and he saw his face in it.
Then he turned around three times, and,
sure enough, his red wings were gone. Then
he went home to his Mammy, who knew
him right away and was so glad to see him.
And he never, <em>never</em> wished again to be something
different from what he really was.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_FIRST">HOW THE FIRST
MAYFLOWERS<br>
CAME.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time everything in the woods
was covered deep with snow, the berries,
the juicy young bushes, and the roots. The
animals had stowed themselves away for the
winter to sleep; the bear in a deep cave, the
chipmunk in a hollow log, and the wild
mouse in a cozy hole beneath the roots of a
tree. The wind sang a high, shrill song in
the tops of the pine trees, and the doors of
the wigwams were shut tight.</p>

<p>But the door of Son-of-a-Brave’s wigwam
suddenly opened a little way and the Indian
boy, himself, looked out. He had his bow
and a newly tipped arrow in his hands.</p>

<p>While the snow and the ice had been piling
up outside in the Indian village, Son-of-a-Brave
had been very busy. He had been
working beside the home fire making his new
arrow head. First, he had gone to the wigwam
of the village arrow maker to ask him
for a good piece of stone. The arrow maker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
had been good enough to give Son-of-a-Brave
a piece of beautiful white quartz.
Then Son-of-a-Brave had set to work on it.
He had shaped it with a big horn knife and
chipped it with a hammer. He had polished
it in a dish of sand until it shone like one of
the icicles outside. Then he had fitted it to
a strong arrow and wished that he had a
chance to shoot. That was why Son-of-a-Brave
stood at the door of the wigwam,
looking out across the snow. Not even a
deer had tracked it because the winter was
so cold.</p>

<p>All at once Son-of-a-Brave saw something.
An old Hare came out of a snow bank and
limped down the path that led by the wigwam.
In the summer the Hare was gray,
the color of the trees among which he lived.
But in the winter he turned white so as not
to be seen by hunters when he went along
through the snow. He did not care now
whether any one saw him or not. He was a
very old Hare, and the winter was too hard
for him. He was lame and hungry and half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
frozen. He stopped right in front of Son-of-a-Brave
and sat up on his haunches, his
ears drooping.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot me,” he was trying to say.
“I am at your mercy, too starved to run
away from you.”</p>

<p>Son-of-a-Brave slipped his newly tipped
arrow in his bow and aimed at the old Hare.
It would be very easy indeed to shoot him,
for the Hare did not move. The boy
thought what a warm pair of moccasin tops
his skin would make. Then Son-of-a-Brave
took his arrow out again, for another thought
had come to him. He knew that he would
be a coward to shoot a Hare that was too
weak to run away.</p>

<p>The boy stooped down and picked up the
old Hare. He wrapped him close up to his
own warm body in his blanket. Then he
went with him through the snow of the woods
until they came to a place where a stream
ran. There were young willow trees growing
along the edge. Here he set down the Hare.
He began to dig away the ice and frozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
earth with his new arrow tip, until the roots
of the trees and the soft bark could be seen.
How the Hare did eat these! Son-of-a-Brave
left him, still eating, and went home.</p>

<p>The Indian boy did not see the Hare
again that winter. He knew that he had
dug a large enough hole so that the Hare
could find shelter and have enough food.
His bow and arrow were hung on the wall,
and Son-of-a-Brave sat by the fire with his
mother and father until spring came.</p>

<p>One day a bird sang out in the forest.
Then the streams began to sing. The moss
made a carpet all over the ground outside of
the wigwam. Son-of-a-Brave felt like running
and shouting. He left off his blanket
and went out into the woods to play.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Oh, what did the boy see there!</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>He had scarcely gone a rod from the wigwam
when he saw a large gray Hare following
him. This was strange for hares usually
ran away. Son-of-a-Brave waited, and the
Hare came close to him. Then he saw,
because it limped, that it was the old Hare
that he had befriended in the winter. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>was now fat and well fed, and dressed in
his summer coat.</p>

<p>The Hare flopped his ears to Son-of-a-Brave
and hopped a little way ahead, so the
boy followed. The Hare went on, without
stopping, until he came to the very spot
beside the stream where Son-of-a-Brave had
dug away the snow to give the Hare food.</p>

<p>Oh, what did the boy see there!</p>

<p>Blossoming out of the bare earth were
beautiful flowers, as white outside as a hare’s
ears in the winter time, and pink inside, like
their lining. They had a sweet perfume,
different from anything that had grown in
the woods before. The grateful Hare stood
beside them. He seemed to say that these
new flowers were his gift to the boy who
had helped him.</p>

<p>The Indians say that those were the first
Mayflowers. They say the Mayflowers have
been blossoming in the woods ever since
because the Hare brought them out of
thankfulness to Son-of-a-Brave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_RABBIT">HOW THE RABBIT<br>
TRIED TO COAST.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, the Rabbit lived in the
woods in a lodge with his old grandmother.
Summer was a fat time for the two, but
things went very badly with them in the
winter. Then, ice and snow covered up the
berries, and there were no juicy, green shoots
to be had.</p>

<p>The Rabbit might have hunted, or gone
to a field and dug down through the snow
to find some buried ears of grain. But he
was a lazy young fellow and disliked the
cold. His grandmother had a hard time
filling the dinner pot, and their cupboard
shelves were more often empty than full.</p>

<p>The Rabbit wished very much that he
might find some easy way of making a living
in the winter. With this thought in
mind he went one frosty day to the lodge of
the Otter, just before dinner time.</p>

<p>The Otter lived in a lonely wigwam by
the side of a river. It was quite a long distance
from the regular camp of the animals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
But the Otter seemed to be well fed and to
have no trouble in getting his dinner. The
Rabbit watched him.</p>

<p>The Otter put his dinner pot full of water
over the fire. Then he took his fish line and
hooks and went outside. He had built a
long, smooth ice slide that went from his
door down the bank of the river. He slid
down this, diving into the water through a
little hole in the ice. In a very short time
the Otter was up again, and carried a long
string of fat eels up to the bank to his lodge.
He popped these into his dinner pot and invited
the Rabbit to stay and share the feast
with him.</p>

<p>It was the first hot meal that the Rabbit
had eaten in a long while. Instead of saving
some of the food for his grandmother,
he ate of it greedily. He tried to think how
he could imitate his friend’s way of getting
a living. He was off as soon as dinner was
over, for he had a plan in his head.</p>

<p>As soon as the Rabbit reached his lodge,
he told his grandmother to put on her blanket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
and tie the kitchen pots together with a
piece of deer thong. He said that they were
going to move. She begged him to think
it over. It was deep winter, she told him,
and she, herself, was an old rabbit. But the
Rabbit took down the lodge poles while she
was talking, and they started away through
the forest to the river beside which the Otter
lived. He set up his lodge on the opposite
bank from that of the Otter. As the weather
was crisp and cold, the Rabbit had no trouble
at all in making an ice slide from his door to
the river, just like the Otter’s slide.</p>

<p>Then the Rabbit told his grandmother to
build a fire, and hang the dinner pot, and
make ready for a great feast. He had invited
the Otter to take dinner with him. The
Rabbit’s grandmother threw up her paws.</p>

<p>“What shall I cook?” she asked. “There
is no food of any kind in the house.”</p>

<p>“I will attend to all that,” the Rabbit
said. Then he started out with his fishing
line to catch a mess of eels as the Otter had.</p>

<p>He stood a moment at the top of his ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
slide, and then he started down it. But, oh,
it was hard for the Rabbit, who was used to
hopping, to keep a straight course on the ice.
He went from one side to the other, and then
turned head over heels, growing quite dizzy.
Then he struck the ice cold water, and went
under, numb with cold. He did not know
how to swim a stroke. He was almost
drowned before he rose to the surface and
was able to cling to a cake of ice. From
this he struggled over to the bank. He
crawled up wet, his teeth chattering, and his
fur freezing all over in tiny icicles.</p>

<p>The Otter had come across the river to the
Rabbit’s dinner party and he stood laughing
on the bank as he saw the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“What ails him?” the Otter asked of the
Rabbit’s grandmother.</p>

<p>“He saw somebody fishing,” she explained,
“and he tried to do the same. He never thinks
for himself.”</p>

<p>The Otter laughed harder than before, as
they helped the Rabbit into the lodge and
warmed him beside the fire. Then the Otter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
caught a mess of eels. The Rabbit’s grandmother
cooked them, and they had quite a
merry dinner after all. But the Rabbit was
very much ashamed of himself. He learned
how to hunt in a rabbit’s way, after that, and
took good care of his grandmother all the
rest of the winter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHY_THE_FIELD">WHY THE FIELD<br>
MOUSE IS LITTLE.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, before there were any
big folks, or any real houses in the world,
the little First Man, and the little First
Woman lived in a tiny lodge on the banks
of a big river. They were the only people
in the whole world, and they were very,
very small, not any larger than your finger.</p>

<p>They ate wild gooseberries, and twin
berries, and black caps. One berry made a
very fine meal for them.</p>

<p>The little First Woman took very good
care of the little First Man. She made
him a beautiful green bow and arrow from
a blade of grass, with which he could hunt
crickets and grasshoppers. From the skin
of a humming bird she made him a most
beautiful hunting coat, all embroidered and
jeweled with bits of gay shells and shining
particles of sand.</p>

<p>One day the little First Man was out
hunting and he grew very weary, wading
through the deep grass, so he laid him down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
beneath a clover leaf and fell fast asleep.
A storm came up, and the thunder roared
and the lightning flashed, but it did not
waken the little First Man. Then the sun
shone, warm, as it does in hot countries,
and the little First Man awoke. Alas,
where was his gay little hunting coat?
The rain had soaked it, and the sun had
scorched it, and it had fallen to pieces, and
dropped quite off the little First Man.</p>

<p>Then he was very angry and he shook his
fist at the great sun. “It is all your fault,”
he cried. “I will pull you down from the
sky.”</p>

<p>He went home and told the little First
Woman, who cried many tears when she
thought of all the stitches she had put into
the coat. And the little First Woman
stamped her little foot at the sun, and she,
too, said it should stay up in the sky no
longer. The sun should be pulled down.</p>

<p>The next thing was to arrange how to
do it. They were such small people, and
the sun was so great and so far away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
But they began plaiting a long rope of grass
that should be long enough to catch the sun,
and after they had worked for many moons,
the rope was quite long.</p>

<p>Then they could not carry it, because it
made such a heavy coil; so the little First
Man tried to think of one of the beasts who
could help him, and he decided that the
Field Mouse would be the most willing.</p>

<p>In those far away days, the Field Mouse
was much larger than he is now, as large
as a buffalo. The little First Man found
the Field Mouse asleep under a tree, and he
had great trouble awaking him, but the
Field Mouse was very obliging. He took
the coil of rope upon his back, allowed the
two little people to sit, one on each ear, and
they started away to find the woods where
the sun first drops down in the evening.</p>

<p>It was a journey of many moons, and
most tiresome. There were many rivers to
be forded, and at each one the Field Mouse
was obliged to take one end of the rope in
his mouth, and swim over with it. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
he would coil it up, and go back for the
little First Man, and the little First
Woman.</p>

<p>But at last they came to some deep, dark
woods where the beasts, the elk, the hedgehog,
and the others, assured them the great
sun dropped down every night, last of all.</p>

<p>Then the little First Man climbed to the
tops of the trees, making slip knots of the
rope, and fastening it to the branches until
he had made a huge net, larger than any
fish net you ever saw. When it was done,
they all hid to wait for evening, and to see
what would happen.</p>

<p>Such a terrible thing happened! Lower,
and lower, fell the sun toward the woods
that he always touched the last thing at
night. And before he could stop himself—down
into the little First Man’s net he
dropped, and he could not get out.</p>

<p>No one had ever thought what would
happen if the sun were caught. Of course
everything was set on fire. The trees
smoked, and the grasses blazed. The little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
First Man and the little First Woman
started running toward home as fast as
ever they could, because of all the mischief
they had done. The elk had his antlers
scorched. The hedgehog was obliged to
dance to keep his feet from burning, and
the other beasts crowded around the Field
Mouse.</p>

<p>“Good, kind Field Mouse,” they cried,
“will you not set the sun free? Your teeth
are sharp. Gnaw the rope, and loose him,
we pray of you.”</p>

<p>So the Field Mouse, who was always most
good natured, climbed to the top of a tree
and gnawed the rope with his sharp teeth,
although it was very hot and uncomfortable
for him. Gnaw, gnaw, and at last the sun
was loose. With a bound it jumped to the
sky, and there it has stayed ever since.</p>

<p>But what do you think happened to the
Field Mouse? The heat melted him down
to the size he is now, and that is the reason
the Field Mouse is so very little.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_FIRST_bears">HOW THE FIRST<br>
BEARS CAME.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, there were only Indians
upon the earth, and the tribes had a Great
Spirit who was their ruler. He had a little
daughter, the Wind-Child.</p>

<p>It was thought that the Great Spirit and
his daughter lived in the largest wigwam of
the world. It was a mountain that stood,
tall and pointed, on the edge of the sea.
The winds raged about the sea coast, and
no one seemed to have any power over them
except the Wind-Child. They would sometimes
obey her, if she came out of her father’s
wigwam, the mountain, and begged them to
be still.</p>

<p>No wonder the winds obeyed the Wind-Child.
Her eyes were as bright as the stars
when the west wind blew the clouds away
from the sky at night. She was as fleet and
strong as the north wind. She could sing
as sweetly as did the south wind. And her
hair was as long and soft as the mists that
the east wind carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>The Wind-Child had only one fault. She
was very curious about matters which did
not concern her.</p>

<p>One day, when the winter was almost over,
there was a gale at sea. The surf rolled up
and beat against the Great Spirit’s mountain.
The wind was so strong that the mountain
shook. It seemed as if it would topple over.
The Great Spirit spoke to his daughter.</p>

<p>“Go out to the lodge of the cave, at the
base of the mountain,” he said, “and reach
out your arm and ask the wind to cease.
But do not go beyond the cave, for the storm
rages and it is not safe for you to go any
farther.”</p>

<p>So the Wind-Child did as her father had
asked her. She stood at the edge of the cave.
She stretched out her arm and the wind
quieted. Then the Wind-Child forgot to
obey her father. The sun came out, and she
saw many bright shells lying on the sand.
The waves had washed them up during the
storm. She left the mountain, and ran along
the beach gathering shells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the Wind-Child had picked up
one shell, she dropped it to go on farther in
search of one that was larger. On and on
she went, always looking for a shell that was
brighter. She suddenly found that she had
gone a long way from home. She could
not see the wigwam. She found herself,
where the magic trail of the shells had led
her, in a deep, dark forest. It was a frightful
place, and the trees shut the Wind-Child
in on all sides.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="135" style="max-width: 40.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/135.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">They seemed glad to see the Wind-Child.</p></figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The forest was settled by a strange race
of grizzly people. They were dark, rough
in their ways, and wore shaggy fur clothing.
Their wigwams were made of the trunks of
trees. They had great fires in the open
places of the woods about which they sat.
They seemed glad to see the Wind-Child.
The mothers crowded around her, and the
children brought her nuts. They gave her
a fur cloak and one of the best wigwams in
which to live. When the Wind-Child begged
to go home to her father, these grizzly people
of the forest gave her sweets to eat. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>let her taste of the thick, sweet maple syrup
that they cooked in their kettles. They
gave her wild honey that the bees had left
the season before in the hollow trees. After
eating these, the Wind-Child forgot all about
her home, and lived with and learned the
ways of these forest people. Years and
years passed and she was still among them,
grown as wild and savage as they themselves
were.</p>

<p>The Great Spirit looked for his daughter
season after season all over the earth, and
still he could not find her. His mountain
was deserted. His voice could be heard
calling her in every wind that blew. Great
drought and famine came upon the land because
he neglected the earth. It was a time
of great suffering. But one day he came
upon the grizzly people. They were moving
their camp from one part of the forest to
another. In their midst was the Wind-Child,
looking almost like one of them. She
knew her father, though, and ran to him,
begging to go home with him. He took her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
in his arms, but he turned in anger toward
her captors.</p>

<p>As the Great Spirit gazed in anger upon the
grizzly people they drew their fur cloaks
over their heads. They dropped down to
the ground at his feet to beg for mercy. The
Great Spirit left the forest. As he did so
these wild people of the woods found that
they could not rise to their feet again. They
were not able to draw their fur cloaks from
their heads. They went about on all fours,
covered from head to foot with shaggy fur.
They could not speak, but could only growl.</p>

<p>They were the first bears, and there have
been bears ever since in place of the strange
savages who captured the Wind-Child.</p>

<p>The Great Spirit took the Wind-Child to
the top of the mountain and they lived there
always. On her return the rain fell and the
sun shone, and there was plenty in the earth
again. But the bear tribe prowled the earth,
hunted by the Indians, because of the Wind-Child’s
curiosity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHY_THE_BEAR">WHY THE BEAR<br>
HAS A STUMPY TAIL.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, in the far away days,
when the beasts walked the land, and talked
like real people, the bear had a long, beautiful,
bushy tail, as fine as the tail of any
other creature, and you may be sure he was
very proud of it.</p>

<p>One winter day the bear was out traveling,
and whom should he meet but Brother
Fox, hastening along with a string of fish
dangling down his back.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Bruin, “stop a bit, friend;
where did you find such fat fish?”</p>

<p>Now, very likely Brother Fox had helped
himself to the fish from some one’s larder,
but he never told the bear; not he.</p>

<p>“It is a secret, about these fish,” he said
to Bruin; “come close, and I will tell
you.”</p>

<p>So Bruin went close to Brother Fox, and
Brother Fox said:</p>

<p>“You must go to the river where the ice
is thick, make a hole in the ice, sit down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
with your tail in the hole, and wait for
the fish to bite. When your tail smarts,
pull it out, quickly. That is the way to
fish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it?” said Bruin. “Well, if you
say it is so, it must be true, Brother Fox,”
and he walked toward the river swinging his
tail as he went, and Brother Fox hid behind
a tree to laugh up his sleeve, and watch.</p>

<p>Well, poor old Bruin got a stick, and
made a hole in the ice. Then he sat down
with his long, beautiful, bushy tail in the
water and waited, and, oh, it was very cold
indeed.</p>

<p>He waited, and waited, and then his tail
began to smart. He gave a quick pull to
bring up the fish, and, alas, the ice had
frozen fast again.</p>

<p>Off came the bear’s beautiful, long, bushy
tail, and he never was able to put it on
again.</p>

<p>And that is why the bear has a short,
stumpy tail, because he tried to fish, as
Brother Fox told him to, through the ice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHY_THE_BEAR_sleeps">WHY THE BEAR<br>
SLEEPS ALL<br>
WINTER.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="full">

<p>Once upon a time, little Brother Rabbit lived,
quite sober and industrious, in the woods, and
just close by lived a big, brown Bear.</p>

<p>Now little Brother Rabbit never troubled
his neighbors in those days, nor meddled
with their housekeeping, nor played any
tricks the way he does now. In the fall, he
gathered his acorns, and his pig nuts, and
his rabbit tobacco. On a frosty morning,
he would set out with Brother Fox for the
farmer’s; and while Brother Fox looked
after the chicken yards, little Brother Rabbit
picked cabbage, and pulled turnips, and
gathered carrots and parsnips for his cellar.
When the winter came, he never failed to
share his store with a wandering field
mouse, or a traveling chipmunk.</p>

<p>Now, in those days, old Bear was not
content to do his own housekeeping, and
doze in the sun, and gather wild honey in
the summer, and dig for field mice in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
winter. He was full of mischief, and was
always playing tricks. Of all the beasts of
the wood, the one he loved best to trouble
was sober little Brother Rabbit.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Brother Rabbit moved to
a new tree stump, and filled his bins with
vegetables, and his pantry with salad, along
came old Bear and carried off all his stores.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Brother Rabbit filled his
house with dry, warm leaves for a bed,
creepy, creepy, crawly, along came old Bear,
and tried to squeeze himself into the bed,
too, and of course he was too big.</p>

<p>At last, Brother Rabbit could stand it no
longer, and he went to all his friends in the
wood to ask their advice.</p>

<p>The first one he met was Brother Frog,
sitting on the edge of the pond, and sticking
his feet in the nice, cool mud.</p>

<p>“What shall I do, Brother Frog?” asked
Brother Rabbit; “Brother Bear will not
leave me alone.”</p>

<p>“Let us ask Brother Squirrel,” said
Brother Frog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>So the two went to Brother Squirrel,
cracking nuts in the hickory tree.</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Brother Squirrel?”
asked Brother Frog; “Brother Bear will not
leave Brother Rabbit alone.”</p>

<p>“Let us ask Brother Mole,” said Brother
Squirrel, dropping his nuts.</p>

<p>So the three went to where Brother Mole
was digging the cellar for a new house, and
they said:</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Brother Mole?
Brother Bear will not leave Brother Rabbit
alone.”</p>

<p>“Let us ask Brother Fox,” said Brother
Mole.</p>

<p>So Brother Mole, and Brother Squirrel,
and Brother Frog, and Brother Rabbit went
to where Brother Fox was combing his
brush behind a bush, and they said to
him:</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Brother Fox? Brother
Bear will not leave Brother Rabbit alone.”</p>

<p>“Let us go to Brother Bear,” said
Brother Fox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>So they all went along with little Brother
Rabbit, and they hunted and hunted for old
Bear, but they could not find him. They
hunted and hunted some more, and they
peeped in a hollow tree. There lay old
Bear, fast asleep.</p>

<p>“Hush,” said Brother Fox.</p>

<p>Then he whispered to Brother Frog,
“Bring a little mud.”</p>

<p>And he whispered to Brother Squirrel,
“Bring some leaves.”</p>

<p>And he whispered to Brother Mole,
“Bring some dirt, little brother.”</p>

<p>And to Brother Rabbit he said, “Stand
ready to do what I tell you.”</p>

<p>So Brother Frog brought mud, Brother
Squirrel brought leaves, Brother Mole
brought dirt, and Brother Rabbit stood
ready.</p>

<p>Then Brother Fox said to Brother Rabbit,
“Stop up the ends of Brother Bear’s
log.”</p>

<p>So Brother Rabbit took the mud and the
leaves and the dirt, and he stopped up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
ends of the log. Then he hammered hard
with his two back feet, which are good for
hammering. And they all went home, for
they thought that old Bear would never,
never get out of the log.</p>

<p>Well, old Bear slept and slept, but after
a while he awoke, and he opened one eye.
He saw no sunshine, so he thought it was
still night, and he went to sleep again.</p>

<p>After another while, he awoke again, but
he heard the rain and sleet beating outside,
and it was very warm and dry inside.</p>

<p>“What a very long night,” said old Bear,
and he curled up his paws, and he went to
sleep again.</p>

<p>This time, he just slept, and slept, until it
began to be very warm inside the log, and
he heard in his dreams the footsteps of birds
outside.</p>

<p>Then he awoke, and he stretched himself,
and he shook himself. He rubbed his eyes
with his paws, and he poked away the mud,
and the leaves, and the dirt, and he went
outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>But was he not surprised?</p>

<p>It had been a frosty night when he had
gone to sleep, and now the woods were
green. Old Bear had slept all winter.</p>

<p>“That was a fine, long sleep,” said old
Bear, as he set out for little Brother Rabbit’s
house to see if he had anything good
for breakfast; “I shall sleep again, next
fall.”</p>

<p>So every summer, old Bear plays tricks
on little Brother Rabbit, but when the fall
comes, he creeps away to a warm, dark
place to sleep until spring.</p>

<p>And so have his grandchildren, and his
great-grandchildren ever since.</p>
